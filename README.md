# Simpsons Ipsum

The project will provide several unique options for generating filler text related to The Simpsons. It will provide a traditional lorem ipsum generator using quotes from specified characters (Homer by default). The plan is to also use markov text generation to add another option for text generation: "Simpsons-like" dialogue that didn't actually occur on the show.
This repository uses the dialogue data from https://www.kaggle.com/pierremegret/dialogue-lines-of-the-simpsons.
