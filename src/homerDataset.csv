Homer Simpson,Oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't understand.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,Nuts.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This isn't going well at all.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no, no. I just wish I knew what to say.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Although, maybe this will help. Now you lost someone special and it hurts. I'm lucky because I never lost anyone special to me. Everyone special to me is under this roof.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's true. Now, you'll have lots of special people in your life, Lisa. There's probably some place where they all get together, and the food is real good, and guys like me are serving drinks. Oh well, maybe I can't explain all this, but I can fix your doll house for you. At least, I'm good at monkey work. You know... monkey. You know what I mean?",,,,,

Homer Simpson,Marge!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where-where are we going?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The way I acted?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So I said: I must get out of these wet clothes and into a dry martini.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I put it there.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I slipped it into your glass as a gag.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm sorry, honey. Can't we just forget it and go to church.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I didn't... I... Oh, you mean inside, don't you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,About last night... you might have noticed Daddy acting a little strange and you probably don't understand why.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Oh, well, it's very tempting. Really a wonderful idea.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge! What are you doing? Are you insane?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marriage encounter weekend, here I come!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They're holding it at Catfish Lake. They couldn't call it Catfish Lake if it didn't have a catfish in it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh dear. If we can't find a babysitter, we can't go. What a kick in the teeth.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, you don't!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, just puttin' a few last things in the trunk.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmmm, bait.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whoa, better get some gas.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,Hmmmm. Gentlemen: I am going to catch General Sherman!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"None of your business, Flanders.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh say... uh... Reverend... are we gonna get a chance to do any fishing?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I see. I also understand bowling expressions.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lucky you don't keep guns in the house.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ohhh, because I got drunk and looked down her dress.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,She's perfect.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, sometimes that can be annoying.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm done.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's true. It's all true.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I only did that a couple of times.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Out at five, catch General Sherman at five-thirty, clean him at six, eat him at six-thirty, back in bed by seven with no incriminating evidence. . The perfect crime.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Would this be a good time to be honest?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're right, I am. Help me, Marge. What do I do to be a good guy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right. But I can't sleep. Can I take a walk?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gotta be a good husband... Gotta be a good husband... Gotta be a good husband.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, kid! You forgot your... WHOA!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Go ahead, General Sherman! Waste your strength, you big ugly catfish. I gotta skillet and a stick of butter with your name on it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Good! Give up!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, fish, you're probably wondering why I'm still here. Catching you will make me the most famous fisherman there is, right up there with... that... the a... bald guy on that cable fishing show.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whoa! Holy mackerel!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I love you, but I must kill you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I AM THE CHAMPIONS / I AM THE CHAMPIONS / NO TIME FOR LOSERS / CAUSE I AM THE CHAMPIONS / OF THE WORLLLLD!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, oh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hi, honey. Uh, oh. How's the marriage retreat going?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you don't know what this fish means. This fish represents a better life for both of us. This fish makes me a champion and a hero.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,To those weirdos in the worm store.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, if that's the way you feel... I'll throw it back.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Watch.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, I did it! I gave up fame and breakfast for my marriage. I fought it for six hours. She says one word and I toss it back. And you're telling me our marriage is in trouble? Come here, baby.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We're back!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Same as usual. Perfectomundo.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I never knew what Superman saw in her. Give me Wonder Woman! And that golden lariat. She can tie me up any time.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I was just kidding, Marge. Hey, what does everyone say to dinner at Krusty Burger? My treat!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, what are you getting at?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A hundred bucks?! For a comic book? Who drew it, Micha-ma-langelo?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, t.s.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No! Now, look, son, we all know that usually when you bug me like this, I give in, so I'm not mad at you for trying. It shows you've been paying attention. But we all know I'm not gonna give you a hundred dollars. Now are you gonna stop bugging me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hee hee, I win! In your face! Yeah! How do you like them apples? Woo hoo hoo!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart! What are you staring at?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart! Stop it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's all the --",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My beer... my beer... my beautiful beer.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What's the problem, boy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, when I was your age, fifty cents was a lot of money.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, I'm proud of you. I was twice your age before I figured that out.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They're fine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Joke's on them. If the core explodes, there won't be any power to light that sign.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How many hairs on my head? Without looking!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I can't believe you guys. There's a human being out there with millions of dollars who needs our help. And you don't wanna cash in? That's why you losers are stuck in this crummy, dead end job.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, sir.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge! Marge! What's my blood type?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, nuts! Extremely rare blood and I don't have it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Earmuffs.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, old man Burns is gonna kick off if he doesn't get some Double-O-Negative blood, but nobody at the plant has it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Woo! Yes! All right! Woo! Congratulations, boy! You've got a date with a needle!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, you have the right to remain silent.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, it's not like I'm asking you to give blood for free. That would be crazy! You're a little young to understand this, but when you save a rich man's life, he showers you with riches. Don't you know the story of Hercules and the Lion?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, probably. Anyway, once upon a time there was a big mean lion who got a thorn in his paw. And all the village people tried to pull it out, but nobody was strong enough. So they got Hercules, and Hercules used his mighty strength, and bingo. Anyway, the moral is, the lion was so happy, he gave Hercules this big thing of riches.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It was the olden days!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, let's go! Emergency! Life-or-death here!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now let's get the show on the road.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Eh.... the boy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mr. Burns... he's okay! Jackpot!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bill... Bill... Summons... Bill... Wait a minute. From C.M. Burns? Is this it? Yes, this is it! Woo-hoo! Woo!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge! Lisa! Maggie! Let's do this out in the yard where the neighbors can see!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, dim the lights! No, turn on more lights! But do something!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's a little thin, but that's okay, could be a check.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Better half,"" Marge. ""Better half.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, there's no check, just a card. But don't panic. I'm sure it tells us what we're getting and where we can pick it up. ""Dear Bart... Thank you kindly for the blood. Yours truly, Montgomery Burns."" It's just a card!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This is some way to show your gratitude. No gold. No diamonds. No rubies. Not even a lousy card. Wait a minute, there was a card. That's what got me so mad in the first place.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you're my wife and I love you very much. But you're living in a world of make-believe. With flowers and bells and leprechauns, and magic frogs with funny little hats...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I promised my boy one simple thing: Lots of riches. And that man broke my promise. Well, I've had it! Bart, take a letter.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Dear Mr. Burns. I'm so glaaad you enjoyed my son's blood. And your caard was just great. In case you can't tell, I'm being sarcastic. You stink!"" Could you read that last part back to me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good. ""You are a senile, buck-toothed old mummy with bony girl arms... and you smell like...""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,An elephant's butt.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yup!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Forget it, Marge!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, all right. You always do that hand thing! And it usually works.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cheap son-of-a...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmmm...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge, you saved me from making a big mistake. Y'know, I finally understand the meaning of mmphm hnmph.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where's the letter?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where is it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, it's somewhere! It didn't just get up and walk away!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, have you seen the letter?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, think very carefully. Where did you see it last?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh huh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why did you do that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll show you mad in the morning.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"She's right. Okay, think, Homer. Don't panic. They don't pick up the mail till noon. There's still time!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Locked, eh? Well, I just might have a little surprise up my sleeve for old Mr. Lock. Step aside, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What does it look like? I'll get our letter so wet, the ink will run and no one will be able to read it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So a few people won't get a few letters. Boo-hoo. You know the kinda letters people write: ""Dear Somebody-You-Never-Heard-Of... How is So-and-So? Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Yours truly, Some Bozo."" Big loss.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now Bart, you keep an eye out for the mailman. Just give me some kind of signal.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's a good one. We'll use that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, uh I-I guess it wouldn't do any good to run, 'cause you're our mail lady and you know my name and address and everything, huh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm still gonna run!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Great plan, Bart.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, I don't know what you're doing, but it's very strange and your father is trying to worry.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oops.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Twenty eight minutes till Burns comes. Time for operation Mail Take.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Homer Simpson.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, well I'll be on my --",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, c'mon, Joey! Do you have to twist my arm?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I've never seen Mr. Burns this mad and he's always kinda mad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Me and my big... letter writing pen!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, here's the plan. You can move in with your sisters and raise the kids. And I'll... die in a gutter. It's practical and within our means.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I got my problems, Moe. Give me another one.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, woe is me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Burns, you brought us a present.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What did I tell you? I'll bet it's filled with diamonds, rubies, sapphires, pearls...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, what does it do?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge! Really, what does it do?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Save a guy's life, and whattaya get? Nothin'! Worse than nothin'! Just a big, scary rock.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute. If I hadn't written that nasty letter, we wouldn't have gotten anything!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Exactly. It's just a bunch of stuff that happened.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Amen to that!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who stole my shirt? Who stole my shirt?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh thank you, Marge -- Pink?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I can't wear a pink shirt to work. Everybody wears white shirts. I'm not popular enough to be different.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh no... Pink. Pink! PINK! It's all over, Marge. It's all over.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You! You did this to me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mmm, thanks -- It looks... Hey, wait a minute! Just because I'm wearing a pink shirt, it doesn't mean I'm some kind of a... pink doughnut-eater! Although it is tempting --",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You don't understand... my son just threw his red hat in with the white laundry...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Print name?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Honey, do me a favor. Fill out this form.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, all right. I'll get Lisa to do it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, you like homework. Could you fill out this form for me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,O-kay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No deal.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, it's no different than the time I let you vote for me. Remember that absentee ballot?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look at him!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Awww.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dog on Fire! Dog on Fire!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, I'm hearing one right now, while I'm trying to watch TV.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart! Shut up or I'll shut you up!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, did I pass?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The devil with his fly open.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's a spill on a floor with bugs goin' after it. They're gonna eat it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Arrghh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The boy! This isn't fair! How can you tell who's sane and who's insane?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who are you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm Homer Simpson, from the Simpsons.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, of course I've heard of you. I mean you'd have to be living under a rock not to know -- what'd you say your name was?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Doesn't ring a bell.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What was that last one?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nope.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow. How do you do that thing with your feet?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, that thing with your feet.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Because I wore a pink shirt.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What'd you wear?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bbl--bbl--bbl--bbl--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Michael, I don't get it. These guys seem as normal as you and me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay. Five times nine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wowww.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Chief.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Gee, I gotta call my family.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, this is so embarrassing, calling 'em from a nut house. I mean, they think I'm a god.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh great! And uh, try to put a good face on this. Tell them this is one of those places where rich women lose weight.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's all right, son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This place is so strange. Mike, I'm ashamed to admit it to another guy, but I'm... scared.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pancakes... football... Boobies...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Was the door locked?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Was it raining?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Were you out of gas?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Baby.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmm... pancakes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's the most flattering thing anyone has ever said to me. Could I have it in writing, please?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not insane.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks a lot, Michael. You really helped me get through this. If you ever find your marbles, come visit us.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You are? Why?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, when I get home, I'm going to wrap my hands around your neck --",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now listen. I'm bringing Michael Jackson home to stay with us for a few days... Isn't that cute -- he's heard of you! Now, make sure we have plenty of cold cuts, and put some beer on ice.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you sure you're here voluntarily?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thanks everybody! It's great to be sane.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Here he is! Here's the guy you wanna see.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh? Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Come off. I'm sane now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not me. I got this.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stupid junk mail... ""You May Have Already Won!"" Yeah, win this... ""Here's Good News for Homer Simpsoy""... I'll see that he gets it. How dumb do they think I am?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh? A check?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah? Well, what makes you so damn sure?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shut up.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I had a feeling it was too good to be true. Every time you get a million dollars something queers the deal.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I never read a magazine in my life and I'm not gonna start now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, a cartoon.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Well dear, you always wanted a compact."" -- Ain't it the truth.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge. Cartoons don't have any deep meaning. They're just stupid drawings that give you a cheap laugh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nah, you go ahead.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"As Tolstoy said in ""Quotable Notables,"" ""Give me learning, sir, and you may keep your black bread.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, look at them staring at that idiot box. God forbid they would ever read something and improve their minds.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh... How about the ""V""?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's not just one magazine, Marge. They take hundreds of magazines, filter out the crap, and leave you with something that fits right in your front pocket.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Those kids don't know what they're missing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We're all gonna sit down as a family and listen to an inspiring story of wilderness survival.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then I heard the sound that all Arctic explorers dread: The pitiless bark of the sea lion. He'll be killed!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't be so...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you're right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmph?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That reminds me! ""Seven Ways To Spice Up Your Marriage.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you have a nice body. And if you'd like to see me in a costume, you have only to ask.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where do you think? This baby never steers you wrong. And it was free. Free!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow! ""Win a Trip to Washington D.C.""! ""All expenses paid... VIP tour""... Oh. It's for kids.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ooh... And Miss? Just one more question --,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sweetheart, there's nothing I wouldn't do for that magazine.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,YEAH! Damn right!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-uh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Who would've guessed reading and writing would pay off?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Playing cards, notepad, aspirin, sewing kit, pilot's wing pin, propellor-shaped swizzle stick, sleeping mask and anything else I've got coming to me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We're all gonna die!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, Marge, that guy has the same last name we do... Taxi!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,BOOOOO!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wowww -- A shoehorn! Just like in the movies!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Shoe goes on, shoe goes off. Shoe goes on, shoe goes off. Shoe goes on, shoe goes off.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid welcoming mint! Y'ello.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wake-up call? It's two AM!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Free food?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh! I love your magazine. My favorite section is ""How To Increase Your Word Power."" That thing is really, really, really good.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Miss? What does the ""I"" stand for?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah! What does the ""I"" stand for again?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmmmmm... Money.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lousy cheap country...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,BART! Get out of the Spirit of St. Louis!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's so funny?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Marge, grow up.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who's that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, are you ready to go to... I'll room service you...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, your other speech was a little more crowd pleasin'.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gimme one of those!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Give her the check!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I was serious.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm almost done.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll be there. Not-y not-y not.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, why doesn't he just say so?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, here we go again. Look, I don't care if Ned Flanders is the nicest guy in the world, he's a jerk. End of story.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Excuse me? Better? Thanks a lot, Marge, you really put me in my place.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't get me wrong, it's worth feeling three inches tall to find out what kind of a person you really are. Marge Simpson... President of the International We Love Flanders Fan Club...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stupid Flanders... always showing off. Go ahead, Marge, have a ball... What if they game back and I was dead from not eating? They'd cry their eyes out. We should have never gone to the Flanders'. Oh, why did we go to the Flanders' house and leave Homer all alone with no food. And I'd be laughing. Laughing from my grave.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What is it, boy? What? Mmmmmmmm... bar-b-que.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, everyone, I'm back! Great to see ya! Nice seein' ya!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, no tagbacks.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The fly was funny and a booger was the icing on the cake...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That was a joke?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... Sounds like a pretty dumb idea to me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fun? Where is this store, Flanders? The merry old land of Oz?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, it isn't.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmm, let's see.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmmm.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Heyyyy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Keep your pants on, Flanders! I'm wishing as fast as I can!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ooooh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmmm -- too far.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay. Ready.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yesssss! Oh yessss! Read it and weep. In your face. I've got more chicken bone!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oooh. That would be a shame.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wouldn't it, Flanders?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, TV gives so much and asks so little. It's a boy's best friend.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"See, Marge? You knock TV and then it helps you out. I think you owe somebody a little apology.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, if it isn't the Leftorium.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Flanders, how's business?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, Flanders, have you sold anything?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm telling you, Flanders' store was dee-serted. So what do you think of your bestest buddy now, Marge?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I do not know what Schadenfreude is. Please tell me, because I'm dying to know.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, come on, Lisa. I'm just glad to see him fall flat on his butt. He's usually all happy and comfortable and surrounded by loved ones, and it makes me feel... What's the opposite of that shameful joy thing of yours?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, those Germans have a word for everything.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, come on boy, this better be worth my ten bucks.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, the touch of death.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, boy. How was class?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that'll learn 'im.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Flanders, when are your busy hours?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lousy. He just sits there all day. He'd have a great job if he didn't own the place.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, well actually, Moe...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Apple, apple, apple... Come on candy bar. Hey, I know you! You're that first apple I didn't want. That sinks it. I'm really gonna let 'em have it this time!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Homer Simpson, sir.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Can I leave, Mr. Burns?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But the note was asking you to --,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um, Mr. Burns...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Flanders.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Flanders. Is everything okay?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I get it. It's not good enough for you, but it's good enough for me! Well, I wouldn't be caught dead buying this... Hello!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll give you twenty bucks for it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You were swindled, my friend. Twenty bucks. Take it or leave it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry! No cash for Neddie! Homer keep all money! Bye bye Neddie! Bye bye!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Twenty dollars?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now I don't want it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I changed my mind. It was a passing fancy. Although perhaps if you threw in a few lawn chairs, maybe that tool bench, it might rekindle my interest.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Bartle- eeboobely, care for a steak-a-rooney?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Daddly-doodly.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Only seventy-five beans!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I know I need to pay them. But there's just so many.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know, but... Wait a minute. I'm Homer Simpson. Ned Flanders lives over there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Flanders is in debt? Are you sure?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, there's a store where...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Knock 'em dead, boy! Kid's gonna be a black belt in no time.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Flanders, I, uh, want to give you your stuff back.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're gonna live in your car?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I know!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why not?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it's all my fault.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes it is.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I was a swine.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen, Flanders, do you still have that store?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Flanders, you open that store tomorrow!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I SAID DO IT!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, Jerry? Homer Simpson. Remember last month, when I paid back that loan? Well, now I need you to do a favor for me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, you lefties. What'd I tell you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's all here, and it's all backwards. That's right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,To Ned Flanders... the richest left- handed man in town.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, look what I got. A genuine official police badge... Calling all cars... come out with your hands up!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's Officer Homer. Heh heh, heh, heh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How much does it pay?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pfft. I make more than that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,... Bart! Have you started smoking?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't lie to me boy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aha! Cigarettes, just as I thought.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, right. Son... I'm gonna teach you a lesson. I'm going to stand here and watch you smoke every one of those cigarettes. Then maybe you'll learn...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, I'll never doubt you again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A job's a job. I mean, take me. If my plant pollutes the water and poisons the town, by your logic that would make me a criminal.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,See? It was all your imagination.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, all right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hee hee, hee-hee-hee! Read 'em and weep boys, another pair of sixes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know if you need a hat check girl, I've got a daughter.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, the only thing going on down there was a lot of male bonding.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Kill my boy! Kill my boy!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait till I get you home, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, not the leader... I mean... Oh, it's true, it's true! All the pieces fit.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I thought he was dead.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eww, lemon... ugh, cherry... hmm, custard... mmm, purple.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, when do we get the check for this?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You know who the real crooks are? Those sleazy Hollywood Producers.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here's good news. According to this eye-catching article, SAT scores are declining at a slower rate.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, this is the only paper in America that's not afraid to tell the truth: that everything is just fine.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What a movie. And that blonde cutie. Does she have assets.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh? Noise. Bad noise!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Critical wha...? Okay, okay, don't panic. Whosever problem this is, I'm sure they know how to handle it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh? AHHH!! It's my problem! We're doomed!!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Gotta think! Gotta think! Okay, somewhere there's a thingee that tells you how to work this stuff. The um... the, uh... the manual! The manual! RIGHT.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who'd have thought a nuclear reactor would be so complicated!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't understand anything! When they look up stupid in the dictionary, there'll be a picture of me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shut up!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Simpson, it's all up to you. It's showtime!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay, think back to your training...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, a side.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, push the button, got it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This is all your fault! Okay, gotta pick a button. Pick a button. Pick a button. Uh, one potato, two potato, three potato, four... No, wait! Bubble gum, bubble gum, in a dish, how many pieces do you wish? No, no!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eenie meenie minee moe, catch a tiger by the toe, if he hollers let him go... Eenie meenie minee... Moe.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you know boys, a nuclear reactor's a lot like a woman. You just have to read the manual and press the right button.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Magic Johnson! Y'ello.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, thank you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, Magic. What if people think a guy's a hero but he was really just lucky?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, Magic.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, I get enough admiration and respect at work. I don't need it here at home.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It tastes so bitter. It's like ashes in my mouth!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What's your problem, boy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That four-eyes with the big nose? You don't need friends like that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What? What is it? What are you doing?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, as long as it's quiet.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, right next to the boss. Eh, he'll never know who did it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh? Wha?...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Their Eanae-eharatou-nah-dule-what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But I really can't tell them anything, sir.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Did it work?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... ladies and... gentlemen...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um, Grace under pressure is no...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whew! Saved by the bell.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,We could have seen a monkey.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He's talking funny talk.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A Jewish entertainer? Get outta here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mel Brooks is Jewish?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Krusty, are you gonna finish that meatloaf or what?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, Krusty, tell us.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, you don't have to follow in my footsteps.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Hey, aren't you a little old for this? You're not even wearing costumes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here you go, kids. Lousy punks...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get a good haul this year?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I am very, very proud of you kids.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'd like to see that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What a dump. Why would Princess Grace live in a place like this?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Eeuhgh. What is this thing?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah? How much?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mom pal, I don't wanna hear your life story. Paw me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why at that little shop, right over... there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh no, wait, it was over there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't shoot, Don't shoot. They're souvenirs.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Forget it, you two. As the pants- wearer of this house, I get the first wish.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, don't flake out on me. That monkey's paw is gonna make our dreams come true.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, a luxury car. Good baby. Good Maggie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now you're talkin'!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, everybody. We're going to the fanciest restaurant in town!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come to think of it, the guy that sold me this thing did say the wishes would bring grave misfortune. I thought he was just being colorful.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, that was very selfish of you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ok, Ok. I'll make a wish that can't backfire. I wish for a turkey sandwich, on rye bread, with lettuce and mustard, And...AND! I don't want any zombie turkeys, I don't want to turn into a turkey myself, and I don't want any other weird surprises. You got it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey... Hmm. Not bad. Nice hot mustard... good bread... Turkey's a little dry. The turkey's a little dry?! Oh foul, accursed thing! What demon from the depths of hell created thee?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but I gotta warn you that this thing is ee ... Yeah, that's what it is. Wanna try it? Heh, heh, heh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I wish I had a Monkey's Paw.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hiya Bart!!! How's my boy! Heh heh. Heh heh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's good that you made that awful thing, Bart. It's real good.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"He gets it from your side of the family, you know. No monsters on my side.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Come on... make it... make it... make it... please... please... please.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shut up boy. If they make this field goal I win fifty bucks.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Slowly... slowly... don't make a sound... don't even think, because he can hear your thoughts... then, when he's least expecting it, bash his head in with a chair. End of monster. Heh heh heh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm not nodding. It's the air conditioning.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ouch!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good night, son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, if you wanted to, you could give me my body back.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, ah, thanks boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I love you, son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You both toilet-trained?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, okay then... ... Four o'clock... Coupla hours I have to get up and go to work... gotta go to work... go to work.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh? What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,For what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How do you know I was sleeping?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Camera?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How hard can it be?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooo, what job is that?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sheesh. What a slave driver.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No. Bart bit me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I gotta go shake the dew off the lilly.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I didn't wake up. It's all a dream. It's just a dream!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Umm. Spaghetti.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I hate having two heads.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Y'ello.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, I know it's tonight.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... isn't this the kind of thing your mother's better at?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow! And after them, out of all the people in the world, you chose me. Uh huh, yeah, number four and a half reed.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whew! Just in the nick of... mmm, beer?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hurry, Moe, hurry! I've only got five minutes till the music store closes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, do I tell you how to do your job?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, if you tip the glass, there won't be so much foam on top.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ah. Finished with fifteen seconds to spare.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The moron next door closed early!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, me and my trenchant mouth.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmm. ""Lisa stop playing that stupid... saxophone!"" Yes! That's it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Please, you've got to open that store.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay. But I want you to see a picture of the little girl you're disappointing. Well I don't have one.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll have you know, I wrote it down.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Number Four and a half -- Stupid gum!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Number Four and a Half reed! Whoo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I dunno.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No!... Wait a minute. What was that last one again?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whew, I'd hate to be that kid's father.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah! Woo! Woo! Yeah!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I ordered it for my little girl. Heh... heh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That cost eighty-eight dollars!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, I let you down and I apologize. I know that doesn't make it right, but I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You didn't mean that!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No wonder she hates me. I never even noticed that she was alive.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Maybe I should just cut my losses, give up on Lisa, and make a fresh start with Maggie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, if I spend any more time doing these girl things, I'm gonna -- you know -- go fruity. No, you were right the first time with that quick fix idea. Let's see, quick fix, quick fix. Ah, I'll buy her that pony she's always bugging me for.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, with today's gasoline prices, we can't afford not to buy a pony.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I've got to get her a pony. When I look in Lisa's eyes, I don't see love anymore.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"See, even when you yell at me, I can see love in your eyes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ha ha, you love me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, yeah, yeah.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mm.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Buh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sneh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Excuse me, do you sell ponies?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Scot-tish deer-hound."" Hey, this is a dog!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now lady, I'm buying this pony for my little girl, and I don't care what it costs.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Half a million dollars?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll take it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, sure... let me write you a check.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is there a problem with that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Isn't there like a pound where you can pick up cheap ponies that ran away from home?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I-I'd like to borrow five thousand dollars.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Burns, you do this personally?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,U-su-ry?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I want to buy a pony.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No. I need to get it for my little girl because she doesn't love me any more.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Of course.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Simpson, you've done it again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sounds like someone's angling for a pony of her own.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Because she stopped loving me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I know you love me. So you don't get squat. Hee hee hee hee.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've got it all figured out. By day it will roam free around the neighborhood. And at night it will nestle snugly between the cars in our garage.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's for the courts to decide. Marge, she loves me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stable? That sounds expensive.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is what love costs a month?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh nuts.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I was hoping it'd be money.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well you know, we're always buying Maggie vaccinations for diseases she doesn't even have.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nah, we're not gonna be doing that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"First you didn't want me to get the pony. Now, you want me to take it back. Make up your mind.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, Lisa loves me, the pony stays.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fine, I will. There's plenty of money out there for a guy who's willing to work for it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do you have any jewelry you don't need anymore?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Need money. Need money.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"One Scratch-for-Cash, please.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Liberty Bell... Two Liberty Bells... come on, come on, come on... Oh. Yes! Whoo-hoo! Three Liberty Bells! That'll be TEN thousand dollars, Apu.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thank you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,There it is.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No! No!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No! You can't see... come on!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let go. You're ripping it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ohh... I need money.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're looking for help?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm your man!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo-hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,...Badge of honor.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I eat... Oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Heh heh, the perfect crime.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, could we go in the other room? I did something last night I'm not proud of and I don't want the kids to hear it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll work form midnight to eight, come home, sleep for five minutes, eat breakfast, sleep six more minutes, shower, then I have ten minutes to spend as I please. Then I'm off to the power plant, fresh as a daisy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmm... salty.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No sir.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes sir.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know. How long do horses live?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mustn't sleep. Must monitor core.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Y'ello.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thanks. When is she gonna stop loving me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Going for... eight hour walk.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Homer sleep now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Coming right up, sir.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, sir.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes I do. You see Lisa, grownups have a thing called money...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You did?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh no! What is it, a hippopotamus!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Awww.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Apu. You can take this job and re-staff it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That baby changed our lives.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oooooh! That's one clean tombstone.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,In the garage.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, give us a break, Doctor.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If stuff starts flying, just turn your head.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay, calm down.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, I will. I will.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Patty, Selma, what a pleasant surprise.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"... Expiration date: June, 1999... Uh, 2012, yeah.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shh! They'll hear you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know. Some guy I guess.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How much?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What's the quickest, cheapest, easiest way to do something with you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Anything for my little girl.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart! You can't weld with such a little flame. Stupid kid.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooooooh, McBain.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why? I just saw the best part.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just grab something. All these movies are great.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh great, you made me miss Joe Theisman.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh Marge.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, let's see, Bart's friends... Well, there's the fat kid with the thing... uh... the little wiener who's always got his hands in his pockets.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay. Hank.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hank... Jones.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Steve McQueen.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Next.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, he's always chewing on that phone cord.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then he has no hobbies.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart!... BART!!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You don't have any hobbies, do you boy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, that's what I... Wait a minute. What are you doing?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that's a hobby!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, my God. I don't know jack about my boy... I'm a bad father!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm also fat!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm Homer Simpson. I just took your test. I got a zero.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Goodbye, son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ho, ho... if he's as smart as he is funny, I'm sold.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, that's easy for you to say, you preachy egg-headed institute guy. How much do you see your son?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, how I envy you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've never been afraid of a little hard work.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What boy?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, he is building a soapbox derby racer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart!... I'm gonna help you build that racer.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay. No, I'm gonna do it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But you can use me. I'm good. I've built a lot of things around the house... The spice rack... The birdfeeder... The gymboree.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What was that? Ah, who cares. Son, please let me help you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh this isn't working at all. It's hopeless... Wait a second.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmm... ""Cosby's first law of intergenerational perversity: No matter what you tell your child to do, he will always do the opposite."" Huh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that sounds too complicated.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, I will! Son, I don't think you should let me help you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thank you, Bill Cosby, you saved the Simpsons!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, Marge, that Bart of ours is a little miracle. His winning smile, his button nose, his fat little stomach, his face alight with wholesome mischief... He reminds me of me before the weight of the world crushed my spirit.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I like our chances, son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is my son and if he doesn't want to wear one you can't make him!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Loser-mobile... heh, heh ... wait a minute!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you nervous son?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay Bart, we've got a lot of work to do on that car. So, I'm gonna pull you out of school for the next couple of weeks...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, the car had a few bugs in it, I admit that. But we're Team Simpson.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,When did I ever teach you that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't be, no. Go ahead, leave me. Go on, go on and win. No, go on and win without your dad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll just sit here in ""Li'l Lightnin'"" -- which the Simpsons built -- and remember that for one brief shining moment, I had a son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why? What's wrong?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, sure, I'll take you, wait with you, worry about you, and then you'll ride home with someone who has a faster car. This is how you get your kicks, isn't it, Lisa?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dr. Hibbert, Lisa needs a. You! Homewrecker!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm not pouting, you are.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No. Can't think of a thing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Leave me alone.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Name your son's hobbies. Building a soapbox racer... ""Name your child's friends."" Martin... Martin! I'll curse that name 'til the day I die... Huh? ""Who is your son's heroe?""...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Three-time Soapbox Derby Champion Ronnie Beck!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, I'm one question away from being a perfect father. ""Name another dad you talked to about parenting.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shut up Flanders. Flanders!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Flanders, Flanders, uh, uh, when should a boy start dating?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Great, thanks.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I talked to Flanders about parenting. I'm a perfect father. Hold on, son, I'm-a coming!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Do it for your old man, boy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's my boy. Nyah-nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, infotainment.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,He's not so fat.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, why are you still up?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, they've got better things to talk about than you. Sheesh, what an ego.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What is it, boy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Is anything the matter, my son? Talk to me, young man.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Say your name? Why should I do that, my lad?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You spoke while you were jinxed so I get to punch you in the arm. Sorry, it's the law. Heh, heh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Run for it boy!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's it. I'm outta here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What's the matter, Moe?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, things are tough all over.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Could I get a beer?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I know a good drink. Really hits the spot. I invented it myself...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,One night Marge's beastly sisters were showing slides from their latest vacation.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"As I stared up at that hairy yellow drumstick, I knew I needed a drink.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Patty, Selma, would you excuse me for a moment?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I decided to mix the little bits that were left in every liquor bottle.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,In my haste I had grabbed a bottle of the kids' cough syrup.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It passed the first test: I didn't go blind.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't know the scientific explanation, but fire made it good.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A ""Flaming Homer"".",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Moe, you got any cough syrup?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Try lighting it on fire.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, it's called a ""Flaming...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe, I haven't seen the place this crowded since the government cracked down on you for accepting food stamps. Do you think my drink had something to do with it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why yes I --,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll tell you what's wrong. That rotten Moe is getting rich off a recipe i gave him!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Take that off this second!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I need to talk to Moe.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I didn't even tell you my name.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Homer Simpson.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Barney?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're my kid's teacher!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get away from me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Moe?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'd rather have a ""Flaming Homer"".",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"How could you do this to me, Moe? This bar was going under and it was the drink I invented that saved it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If there was any justice, my face would be on a bunch of crappy merchandise.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Business, eh? Well let me tell you something. You just lost yourself a customer!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I said, you just lost yourself a customer!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You just lost yourself a customer.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You just lost yourself a customer, Moe!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You just lost yourself a customer.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You just lost yourself a customer.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, my new watering hole.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A beer?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can I have a clean glass?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid Moe... non-inventing... recipe stealing... pug-nosed...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh! Look at me, I'm making people happy. I'm the Magical Man from Happyland in a gum drop house on Lollipop Lane!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, by the way, I was being sarcastic.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Moe... Moe... Moe...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Moe... Moe... Moe.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fools! You poor, pathetic, misguided creatures, choking down your Flaming Moe's. All the time wondering, ""How does he do it?"" Well, I'm going tell you. The secret ingredient is...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Cough syrup. Nothing but plain, ordinary, over the counter children's cough syrup!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hi, Moe. Where's that waitress of yours?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe, sorry I lost you hundreds of thousands of dollars.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I guess so.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ahh. Thanks, Moe. You're the greatest friend a guy could ever have.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, do you think Aerosmith will be in tonight?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, what do they want!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's not fair!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-huh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, that's a lot of money.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, Mr. Smithers, do you have change for a dollar?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Homer Simpson here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I own stock?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So uh, how much did it go up?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah...,,,,,

Homer Simpson,That'd be great.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well... how are you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-huh. So what's my stock up to?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What should I do?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sell! Sell! Sell! Woo hoo! Twenty-five dollars!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooooh... ooh, hot wax... ooh, hammer...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I'd like a bottle of Henry K. Duff's Private Reserve.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"For your information, I just made a cool twenty-five dollars playing the market. Buy low, sell high, that's my motto. I may just quit my job at the power plant to become a full-time stock market guy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Have a Duff, boys!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you guys aren't from around here, are you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I happen to know that he won't sell it for less than 100 million dollars.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey... hey!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You heard?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm afraid I had some great plans, too.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I spent it on beer.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fifty-two hundred dollars? What are you talking about?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What? I sold it all for twenty-five bucks.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Did you buy this car with your stock money?,,,,,

Homer Simpson,Because we send them money?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, woa is me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge, I'm gonna be fired. I know it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, it's not the money. My job is my identity. If I'm not a safety whatchamajigger, I'm nothing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, Battlestar Galactica.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fit, damn you! Fit!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,There.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh? What?,,,,,

Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Auugghh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... all of them?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I sure do!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, ah, I wish the candy machine wasn't so picky about taking beat-up dollar bills... because a lot of workers really like candy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmm. The land of chocolate...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow. Chocolate -- half price!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,La la la la la...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,La la la la la la...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, oh, oh. I'm sorry. We were talking about chocolate?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think I did pretty good in there.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lousy German know-it-alls, who are they to say I'm not safe? Oh what's the matter with this thing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No problems here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm not your buddy, you greedy old reptile!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's right. I lost my job so that you could have another 100 million dollars.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let me ask you something. Does your money cheer you up when you're feeling blue?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, bad example. So let me ask you this, does your money ever hug you when you come home at night?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And does it ever say, ""I love you?""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nobody loves you. Nobody loves you. You're old and you're ugly. Nobody loves you. Yea, yea, yea yea!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nobody loves you...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Na na na na / Na na na na /,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo-hoo! I got my job back!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, this one came with a free corncob pipe.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, what color is it? Blue or purple?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh honey, do you really think you're pregnant?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, and I have the same tightness in my chest and profuse sweating I always get.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, everything's fine. Your mother uh, just, broke her leg.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maybe.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, sure, for you a baby's all fun and games. For me, it's diaper changes and midnight feedings.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but I have to hear about it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Actually, Bart, I threw up more than your mother. ... It all happened at the beginning of that turbulent decade known as the '80s.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Those were idealistic days... The candidacy of John Anderson, the rise of Supertramp... It was an exciting time to be young!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,For several years I'd been dating your mother and working at the local fun center.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, sir.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I was 24 years old, with a beautiful girlfriend and a job with a future...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you're supposed to be listening to my story!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't you ever, ever talk that way about television. Lousy, ungrateful... Can't keep their, whaddyacallit... minds... on any uh...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where do you think you're going? You're gonna listen to my story.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Your mother was living with her two wicked sisters.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You mean like will apes be our masters?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But it gives me time to think.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, girls I mean I mean boys. I, I mean you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, what an ending? Who'd have thought Darth Vader was Luke Skywalker's father.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you're as pretty as Princess Leia and as smart as Yoda.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll bet the guy she was singing that about was real happy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh. Well he's always happy. No, wait. He's always mad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Someday I'll buy you a real castle.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Phew, good.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really? It must be the Champale talking.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't worry. This castle is impregnable!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pass the cookie dough.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Y'ello... Oh, hi Marge...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why? What's wrong?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,... ...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Because it's the honorable thing to do?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, there's something I want to ask you. But I'm afraid, because if you say no it'll destroy me and make me a criminal.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I... Damn it, where's that card?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I wrote down what I was gonna say on a card. Stupid thing must have fallen out of my pocket.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's it say?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's the card. Give it here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So... will you marry me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Woo hoo! Woo hoo! Yeah! She's gonna marry me. In your face, everybody... Woo hoo!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, I had this very same discussion with your mother ten years ago.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, we can't do that! All the kids'll call him Larry Fairy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They'll call him Screwy Louie.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Slob.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Puke.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mucous.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Let's see... Bart, Cart, Dart, Eeart... Nope, can't see any problem with that. Wow! I'll take that ring!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Finally, the big day came. We didn't have much money, so we went to a quaint little chapel just across the state line.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey! This marriage is gonna last forever.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm sorry. I wish I could afford a better place.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I am?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Homer.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,Our first night together as man and wife.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look what I got, Marge, a baby monitor.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Baby to Marge. Baby to Marge. Wah! Wah! Over.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, why don't I apply at the nuclear power plant? I hear they pay pretty well.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pfft. Now you tell me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dear Marge, XXX. Homer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well... It takes me a long time to learn anything... I'm kind of a goof-off...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,... Little stuff starts disappearing from the workplace.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,There's a problem with the reactor?! We're all gonna die!!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nah, they wanted someone good. Story of my life.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow! Kid, I won't let you down.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I swear to you, when you come out of there, the first thing you're gonna see is a man with a good job.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"... And when ye tallow hardens, we remove it from yon mold.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good evening, Madame. You have been selected by the good people of Slash-Co to reap the benefits of their new Nev-R-Dull knife-edge. Here... shake hands with the Slash-Co.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Handle first, handle first...",,,,,

Homer Simpson,Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! I said it first!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't know, I don't know --",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Dear Marge... By the time you read this, I will be gone. You deserve all the finest things in the world. And although I can give them to you, they will be repossessed and I will be hunted down like a dog. Also, it has become clear that your family doesn't want me here.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I will send you every cent I earn for the baby. But you will not see me again until I am a man.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, c'mon, honey. You know how it turns out. After all, you wouldn't be here today if I hadn't become the responsible head of a household.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Big shots with their stainless steel lunchboxes...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,They get donuts?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wowww.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, what do you want?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You want fries with that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Holy cow, you're as big as a house.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, Marge, I just can't. I mean, look at me. I'm a Trainee... They won't even tell me what's in the secret sauce. But I can't buy you a decent wedding ring.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, for you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, sure.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Because I knocked you up?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You the boss?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Step aside! I'll deliver this baby!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, listen to me, Mr. Bigshot... if you're looking for the kind of employee who takes abuse and never sticks up for himself... I'm your man. You can treat me like dirt and I'll still kiss your butt and call it ice cream. And if you don't like it... I can change!!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You mean?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I got the job. I got the job! Whoo hoo! Only in America could I get a job!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge!... Marge!...,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Starting tomorrow, I'm a nuclear technician!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And tomorrow morning, I'm gonna buy your ring back! Then I'm going house-hunting!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh, somebody'll cover for me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, college boy, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, as long as he's got eight fingers and eight toes, he's fine by me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ahh, Bart. Daddy's little angel.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little... He did that on purpose!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, Lisa. Come here for a minute...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Y'know, son, the day you were born I received the greatest gift a man could have.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"As the years went by, your mother and I were blessed twice more.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And not a day goes by that we don't thank God for all three of you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah!!! Whoa! Excellent, Marge!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, ain't that cute... Hey!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mon-ey.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, sorry.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That could be Bart!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He's in for some lovin'.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hm... Bart's birthday's coming up.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Limited?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do you have any of those microphones left?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Y'know, Marge. Bart's really gonna like my birthday present this year. It won't be like those shoe trees I got him last year... or the shelf paper I bought him for Christmas. I'll buy his love yet.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, I'll bet you think nothin's gonna top that cactus. Well, check out my present!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,There's only one can of beer left and it's Bart's.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey boy, how's the microphone working?",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's up?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, that Timmy is a real hero.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, he fell down a well... and can't get out...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, it's more than you did!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You must think we're the worst parents in the world.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, son. Just 'cause you're trapped in a hole doesn't mean you can't live a rich full life. I brought you your Krusty doll...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, don't make me come down there!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why, you little --",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's not our fault. We didn't want the boy, he was an accident.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, could you edit that last part out?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, you'll grow into it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's all I can stands, I can't stands no more. I'm gonna get you outta there myself.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Shh! Marge, he's a good digger.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry son, they're gonna make sure no one ever falls down this well again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, bye-bye belt.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Pfft, my heart is just fine.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A little beer will put out that fire.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whoo hoo! Denver, yeah!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe, I'd like to bet twenty dollars on Denver.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Twenty big ones on Denver.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, Denver. Justify my love.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lousy, stupid Denver.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why did you do that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, just don't say anything and sit down over there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Over.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Over... over... over...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, please, I can't hear the announcer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why didn't you say that before!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, that's a big lock all right. I just don't trust that guy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Huh, they both make a good case.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Line...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, lay it on me, coach.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mm-hm.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cincinnati...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cincinnati.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cincinnati.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, c'mon! Don't you realize this is costing me money?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Doh, not the wind.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,... miles per hour.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ugh, this is ridiculous. What am I supposed to do? Lisa, who do you think's gonna win? The Bengals or the Dolphins?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good, good. Moe, fifty dollars on the Miami Dolphins.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, Dolphins!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whoo-hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fifty big ones!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh-oh. You see, Lisa, Daddy's friend Moe promised to give him fifty dollars if the Dolphins won the game.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I wouldn't call it a bet. It's a little thing Daddies do to make football more exciting.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well... you know... you like ice cream, don't you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And don't you like ice cream better when it's covered with hot fudge and mounds of whipped cream and chopped nuts and -- oh -- those crumbled up cookie things they mash up... hmmm. Crumbled up cookie things...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's right. My God, it's like there's some kind of bond between us.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,YEAH!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You'd think that wouldn't you. But you see Lisa, your mother has this crazy idea that gambling is wrong. Even though they say it's okay in the Bible.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh... somewhere in the back. The point is we had a great time today. And to keep it that way, let's not tell your mother about our little wager. Okay?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You bet.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Me too, honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sure! You'll find it gets rid of the unpleasant after-taste of church.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What? Didn't you hear what he said?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You think we should bet against them?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You got it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe, twenty-three dollars on New York.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, sorry. So who do you like in the afternoon games?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"My daughter, that's who!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, you've picked the winner every time! You must have some kind of special gift.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, my little girl says the cutest things.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not Sunday -- Daddy-Daughter day.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The usual, Moe. A beer and a wad of bills.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I used to hate the smell of your sweaty feet. Now it's the smell of victory.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Tut-tut. Only the best for my family.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, I'm Homer. I'll be your customer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, violin guy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What's your favorite song, Lisa?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Play on.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, Lisa, it's Daddy-Daughter day and Daddy needs daughter's picks.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You promised you wouldn't get mad!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good, good... You call Moe.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Barney, are you nuts? That's the Super Bowl. How about the Sunday after that?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not quite. They were out of the Malibu Stacie Lunar Rovers.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, I know you're gonna like your present.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, Marge. I'll tell you, but first you have to promise you will not get mad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right. If you must know, Lisa and I have been gambling on pro football.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, she never loses. She's got a gift. Aren't parents supposed to encourage their kids whenever they show talent?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Only in forty-eight states. Besides, it's a victimless crime. The only victim is Moe, heh, heh, heh. And it's brought Lisa and me together.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, what's the problem? The kids are happy, you smell like Meryl Streep, and I've got that foot massager I've always wanted.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Believe me, Marge, nothing bad could possibly come of this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, that sounds great honey, but next Sunday I'm going bowling with Barney.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, the new football season is only seven months away.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look Lisa, I bought you a Malibu Stacey Chinchilla coat.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look Lisa, honey, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. But I really had a good time watching football with you. And I think you had a good time with me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, c'mon, we can still watch the Super Bowl together. Can't we? Eh? Huh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's a date! So... do you think the Cowboys will beat the spread?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dallas! Whoo-hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"However? What however? What do you mean, however? However what?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, do me a favor. Complete this sentence: ""Daddy should bet all his money on...""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, every note is like a dagger in my heart. I gotta get outta here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, Moe. I'm not bettin'.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I had the greatest gift of all, a little girl who could pick football and I ruined it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Buffalo's gonna win. Lisa hates me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My daughter.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not Duff Dry... Dallas.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, we're back in business.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Please, please, please...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes! She loves me! She loves me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Money comes and money goes, but what I have with my daughter can go on for eight more years!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's beautiful.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,After I catch my breath... can we... go... home?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I split my pants again. Oooh, can I have two sandwiches today? Make them bologna sandwiches too. Can I have two slices of bologna and cheese...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, can you take my ball to Nick's today? A bottle cap got lodged in the finger hole.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Alley balls?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Alley balls...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey sweetheart, what's the matter?! Not gettin' enough of the good stuff at home?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let me through! Let me through! I'm her husband!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hello? Hello? Is this thing on? Hello?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What should I say?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes it's me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I love you very much.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And uh... later tonight I think you and I should uh, snuggle.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look Marge, I can tell something's bothering you. But if you come out of that car, I promise to do whatever it takes to make it better. Please, honey?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, all's well that ends well. Goodnight, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whaa...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What? But Marge, we just had a vacation. Remember Mystic Caverns?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know you do, Marge. But come on, you know what our vacations are like. Those three monsters in the back seat. ""Are we there yet? Are we there yet?"" And let's face it, I'm no day at the beach either. ""Marge, can I have another sandwich? Marge, can I have another sandwich?""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What? You mean we're getting a divorce? Marge, I can change!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, okay. But you have to swear you're comin' back.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right then.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,She's startin' to give.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"For your information, I can take care of my --",,,,,
Homer Simpson,See? Got her on the first bounce.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Good bye? Where's my clean underwear?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How often should I change Maggie?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, Marge, how do I use the pressure cooker?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hello Maggie.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, honey, mommy went crazy...And went far, far away...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, it's going to be just you and me for awhile. Just you and me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, Maggie. Nummy, nummy num.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,Hello... I'd like the department of missing babies.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, dogs love the outdoors.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but what're ya gonna do?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you're a tool of the dog house makers.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes you are. You've been brainwashed by all those dog house commercials on TV. I know, I'll build him a dog house.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't worry. I just drew up a little blueprint. Now let me walk you through it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This is the door. He goes through that. This is the roof. And this happy character here is the sun. He shines down on the house, see.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid lumber...,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Look, if this is about your camcorder -- I lost it, okay?",,,,,

Homer Simpson,Makes you look like you've got something to hide.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,People are talking... lots of people.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Aye-aye! Admiral Butthead.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Marge, do you want to hear something funny? Flanders thinks I swear too much. Marge, you're not laughing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well what a surprise. Marge sticks up for Flanders! Can we have one conversation where you don't bring up your hero, Ned Flanders?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, we're past that. Marge, maybe I do curse a little, but that's the way God made me. And I'm too old to stop now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well Marge, self-improvement has always been a passion of mine. Bring on the swear jar.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do I have to pay if I hit my hand with the hammer?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What if I catch on fire?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What if I see something really weird in the sky?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What about when we snuggle?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,God --,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ohh, you son-of-a.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You dirty bas...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What do ya think, Lisa?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, he just goes... Ohhh",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh fudge, that's broken.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fiddle dee dee. That will require a tetanus shot. I'm not going to swear, but I am going to kick this doghouse down.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where'd you get the money?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maggie. Oh. Cute.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Beer! How did you know?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, this is your teacher? I should start going to parents night.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, you've got to go to your teacher and tell her the truth.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge. I only said it because I thought that's what you wanted to hear.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Step aside everyone. Sensitive love letters are my specialty.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Dear Baby, welcome to Dumpville. Population: you.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I may hold you to that, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Three simple words. I am gay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,P.S. -- I am gay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"How about, ""With a love that will echo through the ages?""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mmm, do - nuts.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't tell me how to eat donuts --,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Softball?,,,,,

Homer Simpson,What's the matter with you guys?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, I know it wasn't our best season.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, this year's gonna be different.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I have a secret weapon.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come here boy, I want to show you something.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's something very special. A home-made bat. It all started last year, during a terrible thunderstorm, when I locked myself out of the house...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sheltering myself with a large piece of sheet metal, I ran for cover under the tallest tree I could find.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Something told me this was a very special, very magical, piece of wood that I could make a bat out of.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I put my homemade football on hold and set to work making the world's greatest bat.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And here it is.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let's see... we play thirty games... ten at bats a game... three thousand.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Check it out, boys. My magic bat.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, just watch.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoooooo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ha ha. Cops can't win!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kids, kids, kids. You can each get me a beer. But first let's see it again in super slow motion.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I did! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! In your face, Strawberry!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're Darryl Strawberry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You play right field.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I play right field too.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, are you better than me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's not fair. Me and the guys worked so hard to get to the championship game and now we'll be sitting on a bench.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, forget it. He's bigger than me, faster than me, stronger than me and he already has more friends around the plant than I do.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well now that you're a little bit older, I can tell you that's a crock. No matter how good you are at something, there's always about a million people better than you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I got it! I got it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I called for that!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"These guys aren't so tough. I've got ""Wonder Bat.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Please, please, please, I want to make the team. Clemens, did I make the team?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,One thing I'm good at and I can't do it anymore.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Like what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but none of my friends can watch me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where do you think you're going?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no, no! I don't want you to see me sitting on my butt.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"They're gonna win the championship, no thanks to me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I am? Whoo-hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh uh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Got it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, sir!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lurleen.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good one, Lenny.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So what're you gonna be, boy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, the Army said I was too heavy. The police said I was too dumb.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute. Isn't anybody gonna follow in my footsteps?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid fingers.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, I didn't steal that copper wire. I just thought they were throwing it out. Here, take it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Good for you. Maybe this'll straighten the boy out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We always have one good kid and one lousy kid. Why can't both our kids be good?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maaarge... The dog doesn't count as a kid.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,One hundred and thirty million dollars!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, I need some lucky numbers, fast! How old are you? Uh-huh, and what's your birthday? No kidding. And what's Lisa's birthday?... What? You don't know your sister's birthday? What kind of brother are you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You'll never guess what happened Marge! Are you ready? I... have... a feeling... that we may win... the lottery!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know you're excited, but calm down and listen to me carefully. Go-get-all-your-money...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You don't understand, Marge. The lottery is the one ray of hope in my otherwise unbearable life. Uh, the lottery and you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, Money... I mean Honey. Ooooh! Here comes a news report about the lottery!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, down in front.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whoo-hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've never been so sure of anything in my life. I am going to win this lottery.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Correction. Three hundred and eighty million to fifty. So what are you gonna do with your share of the money, kids?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What do kids know about spending money?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmm...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look closer, Lenny!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fourteen carat gold!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Take a hike boss, I'm running things now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've got so many tickets I can't lose!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Receipts, ugh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well why didn't you tell the rest of us? Why did you keep it a secret??? If you were seventeen, we'd be rich! But no! You had to be ""10.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dad, you shouldn't say the dog's dead when he's not.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you did the best you could.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well... I guess we'll have to talk it over.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh... later. First, I want to tell you about the most wonderful place in the world... Doggie Heaven.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"In Doggie Heaven, there's mountains of bones and they can't turn around without sniffing another dog's butt! And all the best dogs are there. Old Yeller... and about eight Lassies and...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well... of course. There couldn't be a heaven if there weren't a hell.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... Hitler's dog... and that dog Nixon had... whassisname... uh... Chester.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah. And one of the Lassies is in there too. The mean one. The one that mauled Timmy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But it'll be okay... we'll get him a new dog... one with an untwistable stomach...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, come on! I'm sorry, but we just can't afford it. Marge, make him stop.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right. All right. We'll find a way. Lousy manipulative dog.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... Mr. Burns... I need to borrow some money.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I know you're a good man... and I have a dog that's very sick...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I thought maybe you...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh. Well, thanks for your time.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But Marge! It looks so easy! Just like carving a turkey.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Maybe you're right, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whattaya got, Marge? Insurance scam?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Chub? I don't even know what that is!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I've figured out an alternative to giving up my beer. Basically, we become a family of traveling acrobats...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lousy chub night. Hey, how come he gets meat and we don't?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmm... snouts.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, he's got all the money in the world, but there's one thing he can't buy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A dinosaur.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,BUFFALO GALS WON'T YOU COME OUT TONIGHT / COME OUT TONIGHT / COME OUT TONIGHT... OH BUFFALO GALS...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,AND DANCE BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOONNNNNNNN!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My quarter!!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know you can't understand me, but you're a lousy dog and I hate you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you mean tonight.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart! Close the gate.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh he's gone and he's never coming back. Wait! There he is. No... that's a horse.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh...the last one.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That was his dish, and that was his leash, and that's where he took a whiz on the rug.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge! There is no such place!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Or... to put it another way... there is.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I'll be right here watching TV.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Two tickets for...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let me pet him again!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I know. I want to pet him again!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The cat? What's the point?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, there's a good one.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, that's just a suggested car size.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Easy... easy... How'm I doing on the right?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh huh... easy... easy... perfect. All right, everybody out the window.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, they all look great.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look Who's Oinking! ""Look Who's Oinking""!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's right.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why Marge, you frisky little devil.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We'll take two tickets to ""The Stockholm Affair.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Political!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, this movie's too complicated... Hey, the floor's sticky...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Who's that guy?... What did that guy say when I said, ""Who's that guy?""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that submarine's so fake... Look, you can see the strings... Ooh! An octopus!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think that guy's a spy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh wait, I heard how this ends. It turns out the secret code was the same nursery rhyme he told his daughter.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, it's pretty obvious if you think about it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I have always carried myself with a certain quiet dignity. Tonight you robbed me of it. I'm going now and I don't know when you'll see me again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmm...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ew, a skunk!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh no.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, a redneck bar.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Duff please.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, Fudd me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid Marge tell me to shut up.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,... that's true.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-huh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's right, except for the pick-up truck.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no. I went to this bar the other night, and they...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey... Hey, Lurleen! I've gotta say somethin' to ya.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Your song touched me in a way I've never felt before. And which way to the can?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Homer J. Simpson.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's a pretty name.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maybe. I'm not sure. I forgot it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bye Lurleen.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Y'ello.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I was just up at this bar in Spittle County.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, let's end this feudin' and a fussin' and get down to some lovin'.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I WORK ALL DAY FOR SOME OLD MAN/ I SWEAT AND BREAK MY BACK/,,,,,
Homer Simpson,YOUR WIFE DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU/ BUT I DO...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Moe, you got any Fudd?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe, I was a hundred miles outta town.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lurleen, I can't get your song outta my mind. I haven't felt this way since ""Funky Town.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do you think I could get a copy of it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lurleen, we've gotta crack open your head and scoop out those songs!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Come with me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I guess so.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Shut up, boy. Marge, what do you think?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, right now she's an out-of-work cocktail waitress. But she's going to be a country music superstar like... uh... that jerk in the cowboy hat... and that dead lady.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you make it sound so seamy. All I did was spend the afternoon in her trailer watching her try on some outfits.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well hi, Lurleen. We were just talking about you. Uh... I think I can come over. Let me ask my wife.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't thank me, Lurleen, you should be thanking your brain.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I was going to ask you for a glass of water, but now I feel kinda guilty about it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks. You did say sugar, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Really? Well, I should warn you... I'm not great with figures...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I make a lot of stupid decisions...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I did bad in school.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My personal hygiene has been described as...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, look at me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, then maybe you better not look at me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A friend bought it for me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No... I think it was Lenny.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A coupla times.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't. I'm her manager.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you're standing in the way of my boyhood dream of managing a beautiful country singer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, Lurleen's gonna be a big success and whether you like it or not, I'm going to be there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm sure Lurleen will love it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Calm down, Marge, it's just our life savings. I'm not going to go into hock for this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't have time to answer all these questions. Uh, time is money. Come on, people!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stop it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You, off the bench.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Guess what, Lurleen, I got you a gig on TV.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey! Oh, you meant that as a compliment. Now on this show, they want you to sing two songs. Maybe we should give them something new.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let's hear it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that's hot. There isn't a man alive who wouldn't get turned on by that. Well, g'bye.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-huh...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Right...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... I gotta think about this.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Later, Marge. Lurleen's on TV tonight. I gotta get ready.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's great, honey. Say, have you seen my rattlesnake hatband?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sure they will.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... I gotta go.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes I am.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Forget it, pal. They don't call me Colonel Homer because I'm some dumb-ass army guy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lurleen, they loved you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is there anything you need?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My whole romantic life is flashing before my eyes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,At least could I have my dollar ba...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm sorry Lurleen. All I wanted to do was share your beautiful voice with other people and I've done that. Now I better get out of here before I lose my family.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just so I don't wonder... You would've gone all the way with me, wouldn't you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now before we negotiate, I have to tell you I'm desperate to unload Lurleen. And I'll take any offer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You son of a... Sold!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is there any room in that bed for a dad-burn fool?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look Maggie, they have a baby, too.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pfft.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ooooh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Gee, if some snot-nosed little kid sent me to prison, the first thing out, I'd find out where he lives, and tear him a new bellybutton.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lousy snitch.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I am not.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hear hear!.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, appetizers.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, you can't go wrong with cocktail weenies. They taste as good as they look. And they come in this delicious red sauce. It looks like catsup -- it tastes like ketchup. But brother it ain't ketchup!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, would you two knock it off? I hate all the programs Marge likes. But it's no big deal. You know why?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whenever Marge puts on one of her nonviolent programs, I take a walk. I go to a bar, I down a few, and I stumble home in the mood for love.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Wiener Boy... Where do you think you're going?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, and after we watch this, we can tape over it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, down in front.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Come again?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,To the Simpson mobile!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, my concert going jacket still fits. And this is where I used to hide my beer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Billy Beer!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Marge, I went to thousands of heavy metal concerts and it never hurt me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I hear ya. Come on boy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, just meet me back here after the show.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, some of the best times I've ever had were in the back seat of a car.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Baby!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,THERE WAS A LITTLE SPANISH FLEA... A RECORD STAR HE THOUGHT HE'D BE... HE HEARD OF SINGERS LIKE BEATLES... THE CHIPMUNKS HE'D SEEN ON TV... WHY NOT A LITTLE SPANISH FLEA? AND SO HE HID... INSIDE A DOG...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll be right back.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, that's a waste of money. We already have a guitar.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is real.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now boy, we spent a lot of money. So you better get real good real fast or pow!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I thought I was supposed to encourage him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, what were you thinking?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, everybody says that when they hear themselves on tape.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Forget it. That line didn't work for my dad and it's not gonna work for you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, but doesn't the Bible also say, ""Thou shalt not take moochers into thy... hut""?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right. He can stay. But I get to treat him like garbage.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Will you knock it off! I can't hear myself think.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's better. Hey, how come you never play your guitar anymore?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, come here. Heh, heh, heh. Of course I'm not mad. If something's hard to do, then it's not worth doing. You just stick that guitar in the closet next to your short wave radio, your karate outfit, and your unicycle and we'll go inside and watch TV.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It doesn't matter.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Open up! Open up! I gotta go and no fooling.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That guy has gotta go.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's it. He's outta here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't care. This is not ""Happy Days"" and he is not the Fonz.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen you drain clogging, last cookie-eating, collect call-getting sponge, I want you out of my house!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So long stomach. We've had a lot of great memories.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This sucks. Where is that channel changer?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, eh, I'll give it a chance.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Chocolate...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, sweet.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'd say ""You're a lying scumbag."" Why sweetie?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Lisa, that's a load of rich, creamery butter.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lose weight and listen to new-age music? Wow! What do you think, Marge?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen, Tabouli, we're ignoring all of your demands. What do you say to that?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lamentably, no. My gastronomic rapacity knows no satiety.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Forbearance is the watchword. That triumvirate of Twinkies merely overwhelmed my resolve.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Tut tut, gentle Marge. For here in the boudoir, the gourmand metamorphasizes into the voluptuary!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now there's a Machiavellian countenance.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ooh...a sextet of ale.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The vernal equinox?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Disingenuous mountebanks with their subliminal chicanery! A pox on them!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, where's that... metal dealie... you use to... dig... food.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yuh. Yuh. Yuh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah that's good.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Forgot there was a physical today, huh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Go to hell.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, the usual. Stand in front of this, open that, pull down this, bend over, spread apart that, turn your head that way, cough...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Herb?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the hell are you two...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, my couch! The arms, the seat... the dream is over. All right, who did this?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, why did this have to happen now, during primetime, when TV's brightest stars come out to shine!?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, goodbye, old girl. We've had a lot of great memories.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Boring.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well friend, you're going back where you came from. The curb in front of Flanders' house.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah. You know, my life just can't get any worse.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's right. There's no way my life could possibly get any worse.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Would I!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute. I'm not signing anything until I read it, or somebody gives me the gist of it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't I get some kind of trophy? At a big award ceremony?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Herb!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Please please please please please...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't jinx it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, my God!! Woo hoo! I win!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I miss my couch.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pfft! Heavyweight championship. There's like three of those. That couch was one of a kind.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think I'm gonna take a walk.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I feel so empty. So alone, so... couchless.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow. The Spine Melter 2000.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Give me full power.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dammit, I said full power!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll take it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, there's an empty spot I've always had inside me. I tried to fill it with family, religion, community service. But those were dead ends. I think this chair is the answer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, we won't get the chair. Now excuse me while I kiss the sky.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They're singing again. Lousy neighbors. Wish I was deaf.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You weren't so glad to see me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, while you're a guest in my home, could you just kick me in the butt?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Herb, let me give you the grand tour. This is one of our many light switches. It functions in both the on and off mode.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,On... off... on... off.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah. Right. I don't know what this switch does.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They do good work.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Broke again, eh Herb? Just like in real life. I guess you're just not much of a businessman.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait, Marge. Didn't you want to spend that money on a vibrating chair?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Twenty minutes?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's drinking the water!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is the greatest invention in the world! You'll make a million dollars!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's going back for more!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, Herb, I'll lend you the two thousand bucks. But you have to forgive me and treat me like a brother.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, then just give me the drinking bird.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Herb, this is the stupidest thing I've ever seen. I can't believe we blew two thousand bucks on it, when right now rollers could be kneading my buttocks.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I try, but I can't.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Never mind.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I dunno, Herb. People are afraid of new things. You should have taken an existing product and put a clock in it or something.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I gave Herb all the money I had in the world... and still he treats me like something he dug out of his ear.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, when is he gonna act like it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Herb, I don't think there's a vibrating chair in that bag for me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What do I get? What do I get? It's not another punch in the face is it? Because if it is, I don't want it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I see your point, brother.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right... but I never really hugged a man before.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wake up, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well it is.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sure do. When you're eighteen, you're out the door.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now listen, boy. We have an understanding and you'd better keep your end of it. I don't think I'd be any kind of a father if you got D's and I let you go to Kamp Krusty.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, if you really want something in this life you have to work for it. Now quiet, they're about to announce the lottery numbers.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo-hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid roller-skate.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A+? You don't think much of me, do you boy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You know a D turns into a B so easily. You just got greedy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, Bart. We made this deal because I thought it would help you get good grades. And you didn't. But why should you pay for my mistake?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah. I didn't want you hangin' around all summer anyway.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks son. Now, you've got little hands. Can you reach under that mower and pull out that skate?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, am I crazy, or is my back getting hairier?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't see your name on it, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Check... mate.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Leaves of 4, eat some more.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh no you're not.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He-he-he.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, since the kids left, I lost five pounds!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And look. New hair!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm this close to having a comb-over!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Size... right... agility!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, kids' letters from camp.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, we've got all the fireworks we need right here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sounds interesting.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sounds interesting.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A beaut from Butte.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nothin' could be finah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"She, uh... Good for her.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge keep it down in there.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maggie! Cut that racket!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And where exactly are you going?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, this is the first I've heard about it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Excuse me, Marge. I think that if you told me I would remember! I mean I'm not an idiot!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kids, back me up.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Match point, Homer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's okay. We're none of us perfect.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, don't ask stupid questions. Is there any frontal nudity?",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"You see, Marge, while you're off in your little world, you forgot that other people have problems too.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, your ride's here.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,Yeah. How Blanche was sad and how that guy Stanley -- should have been nice to her.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I mean it made me feel bad. The poor thing ends up being hauled to the nut house when all she needed was for that big slob to show her some respect. At least that's what I thought. I have a history of missing the point of stuff like this.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you know. I'm a lot like that guy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, like when I pick my teeth with the mail and stuff...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ahhh, another beautiful day in the womb. La-la-la-la--la-... ...la-la-la... la-la-la...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Leggo! Leggo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm all naked and wet!,,,,,

Homer Simpson,Could this be the best day of my life?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Looks like we have a new champion.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, my beloved family. How was church?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I, on the other hand, have been having the best day of my life. And I owe it all to skipping church!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Like fun I don't. Marge, I'm never going to church again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No! No, no, no, no, no, no. Well, yes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's the big deal about going to some building every Sunday? I mean, isn't God everywhere?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And don't you think that the Almighty has better things to worry about than where one little guy spends one measly hour of his week?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And what if we picked the wrong religion? Every week we're just making God madder and madder.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, come to bed.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maarge... come to bed Marge...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's good for what ails ya...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can wait all --,,,,,
Homer Simpson,God?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well... kind of... but...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And YOU remember... Matthew... 21:17.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm not a bad guy. I work hard and I love my kids. So why should I spend half my Sunday hearing about how I'm going to hell?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No. They moved to Phoenix.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You know what I really hate about church? Those boring sermons.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Give him one for me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So I figure I should just try to live right, and worship you in my own way.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sure, honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, Sweetheart. If I'm wrong, I'll recant on my deathbed.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, my animal friends. Peace be with you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Guys, please, could you give me five minutes?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I wasn't sure I was doing the right thing. But then God Himself told me I should seek a new path.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, he appeared before me in a dream, and I knew that was special 'cause I usually dream about naked... Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Perfect teeth - nice smell - a class act all the way.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah... think about it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, work? This is Homer Simpson. I won't be coming in tomorrow -- Religious holiday... The uh, Feast of... Maximum Occupancy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, you should join my religion, Moe. It's great. No Hell... no kneeling....",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No sale.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Leave me alone!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where are we going?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kids, let me tell you about another so-called wicked guy. He had long hair and some ""wild"" ideas and he didn't always do what other people thought was right. And that man's name was... I forget. But the point is... uh, I forget that too. Marge, you know who I'm talking about -- he used to drive that blue car --",,,,,
Homer Simpson,There you go again. Always taking someone else's side. Flanders... the water department... God...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Very sure.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh! An interview with Lorne Michaels... wait, that's no good. Hey, now we're talkin'. ""Our Unabashed Dictionary defines IUD as 'Love Springs Internal'."" I don't get it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute, is this a religious thing?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Apu, I see you're not in church.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Ganesha, want a peanut?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No offense Apu, but when they were handing out religions, you must have been out takin' a whiz.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, everyone is stupid except me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, turn down the heat. That's better.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fire! What do I do? What do I do? Oh, the song! The song! WHEN A FIRE STARTS TO BURN / THERE'S A LESSON YOU MUST LEARN / SOMETHING... SOMETHING, THEN YOU'LL SEE/YOU'LL AVOID CATASTROPHE!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Flanders, you saved me. Why?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's right, old friend.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"My Magazines and roach traps... gone, all gone.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, wait a minute... Flanders is a regular Charlie Church and God didn't save his house!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, the Picasso... my collection of classic cars...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, that's just great.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, I have a feeling there's a lesson here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, don't tell me, I'll get it... Oh, I know! The Lord is vengeful! O Spiteful One! Show me who to smite, and they shall be smoten!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I was rude to every one of you... and you saved my life, when you could have just left me to fry, like the proverbial pancake that I am.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll be there next Sunday. Front row, center!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"God, I gotta ask you somethin'. What's the meaning of life?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,C'mon.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't wait that long.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, tell me now!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ha, ha, you lose! 36 and 239!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A ride on the Duff Blimp...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ho-mer, Ho-mer, Ho-mer..",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it's no fair. We'll never have a buffer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I want that one.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my God!,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Honey, what's wrong?",,,,,

Homer Simpson,Now that's not true! You're cute as a bug's ear.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dad, am I cute as a bug's ear?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There, see?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe, have you ever felt unattractive?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"How about you, Barney?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I need help.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lisa's age seven to nine!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That could be Lisa!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Barney, will you give me 250 bucks for this blimp ticket?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where'd you get all the money?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, if you could have one wish, what would it be?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, was your second wish to be entered in the Little Miss Springfield Pageant?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I sent in an application for you. I couldn't find a big enough photo, so I sent in that funny drawing of you on roller skates.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I think she'll win.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, nobody's prettier than my little girl.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,Hey there blimpy boy Flying through the sky so fancy free --,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, when Lisa comes in, I want you to make a big fuss over how she looks.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,I'll tell you when you're older.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,Take that Washington!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eat lead, Einstein!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Show's over, Shakespeare!",,,,,

Homer Simpson,Oh no. I'm not making two stops.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, I'll talk to Lisa's teacher this year. You can have Bart's.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,If you don't start making more sense we're gonna have to put you in a home.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Then we'll put you in the crooked home we saw on ""60 Minutes.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dad, you and your stories... ""Bart broke my teeth""... ""the nurses are stealing my money""... ""this thing on my neck is getting bigger""...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, look at that hangdog expression. He's learned his lesson. Let's get him a present.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, all right. Young man, since you broke Grampa's teeth -- he gets to break yours.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"No tricks, boy. I said I'm gonna punish you and come Hell or high water I... wait a minute...",,,,,

Homer Simpson,I'unno.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right. All right. Bart, go to your room.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How could you let this happen?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh. How convenient.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can't he be both like the late Earl Warren?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now who's being naive.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, Marge. I swear to you, the next time he does something wrong I'll punish him and make it stick.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, but the punishment stands.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, didn't I ask you to watch Maggie?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, boy. This calls for the biggest punishment I've ever handed down. And this time it's gonna stick!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Damn right. Bart, you can't go to see that Itchy & Scratchy movie. Ever!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't point that thing at me. I said you're not going to the movie and I'm sticking to it.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"... LOVE YOU, SUCH A SWEET THING/ GOOD ENOUGH TO EAT THING...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Someday you'll thank me for this, son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, it's true. You know, when I was a boy I really wanted a catcher's mitt. But, my dad wouldn't get it for me. So I held my breath until I passed out and banged my head on the coffee table. The doctor thought I might have brain damage.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I like stories.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know my punishment might seem a little harsh, but I can't go back on it. You're welcome to watch anything you want on TV.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know you're upset right now, so I'll pretend you didn't say that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But then I won't be watching TV. You can see the bind I'm in.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't you think I know that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, sweet soft-hearted Marge. You just can't see the big picture. If I stick to my guns, the boy could wind up Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. If I fail, the best he could do is judge at a ""Mister Tight Buns"" competition. I can't let that happen, I won't let that happen and I can't let that happen.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, son, we both won. You don't know it now, but I've started you on the road to somewhere very special.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right. I think you've learned your lesson.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll get it son.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmm... Soylent Green.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Which one's the mouse?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Itchy's a jerk.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, give it here.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Hand me my patching trowel, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmm.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wha-do I do...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Did you see the bubble?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Forget it. You're not the only foundation guy in town!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Let's see, foundation repair... Ah, here we are...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, it'll cost eighty-five hundred dollars. We only have five hundred in the bank. That leaves... eighty- hundred we need.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey! Then I could follow my dream. Living in the woods and keeping a journal of my thoughts.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"March 15... I wish I'd brought a TV. Oh God, how I miss TV.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bo-ring!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bo-ring.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's in there. Look, Marge we just don't need the money that bad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge have you seen my lunch box?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you're making a big mistake. I'm going to see you all day at work and all night at home...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And that's good! But, here's the bad part... uh... uh... Ooh, look at that headline: ""Canada To Hold Referendum."" Sorry Marge, can't talk now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, lemonade is good.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wha dey do?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, Marge, just remember, if something goes wrong at the plant, blame the guy who can't speak English. Ah, Tibor, how many times have you saved my butt .",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge what're you doing? It's lunch time.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, Marge, Marge, let's file this under ""R"" for arrivederci.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, baby. That tube'll know what to do.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, get my gun.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You can't take our donuts!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, man, I really gotta...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm used to seeing people promoted ahead of me... friends... co-workers... Tibor... I never thought it'd be my own wife.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you kidding? I work like a Japanese Beaver.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I won't sleep in the same bed with a woman who thinks I'm lazy. I'm gonna go right down stairs, unfold the couch, unroll a sleeping bag... Eh, goodnight.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've got a better idea -- get the hell out!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He left his briefcase. Hey! It's full of shredded newspapers.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No! Mr. Burns, I'm not leaving until you say you're sorry for what you did to my wife.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Damn right!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Gotcha. Marge, we're gettin' some drive-thru then we're doin' it twice.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Homer, you're not listening!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, Marge. Maybe I'm not getting enough ...estrogen.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aye, aye Captain! Marge, we're going to that restaurant.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mmmm, shrimp.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There you are! Thought you could get away, huh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My hammock! Do you understand? Mine! Don't look that way.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...All you can eat, ha!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Shut up, you little monsters! Hello, I was wondering if you'd like to baby-sit my little angels.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No ""All You Can Eat Seafood."" I wore my extra-loose pants for nothing. Nothing!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Great. Oh, uh... and there was something else. Something I was supposed to tiptoe around...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's it! Whew, I'm glad one of us remembered. That could have been embarrassing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Heh heh, I know what you mean. Just let me make sure we're not talking about food.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Right. Me neither. We're talkin' about sex, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I hear you loud and clear.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All you can eat. All you can eat.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"But Marge, I think he should learn about it the same way I did.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Maybe you're right. Now, if you'll excuse us, this is a sacred moment between a boy and his father.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, a woman is a lot like, uh... ... a refrigerator. They're about six feet tall, 300 pounds... they make ice and ... Oh, wait a minute, actually, a woman is more like a beer! They smell good -- they look good -- you'd step over your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You want to drink another woman!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So I says, ""Yeah, if you want that money, come and find it 'cause I don't know where it is you baloney..."" You make me wanna retch...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I married her!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, that means a lot to me.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Done and done! Heh, heh, heh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Lenny, can you get this Sugar Daddy off my back?",,,,,

Homer Simpson,Who is it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hired goons?,,,,,

Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Haw, haw. April Fool's! I've been keepin' that carton of milk next to the furnace for six weeks! Sucker!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You talk better than you fool.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You couldn't fool your mother on the foolingest day of your life if you had an electrified fooling machine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ahhh, what noble visionary thought up April Fool's Day?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,God bless those pagans.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Happy New Year!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And that's the story of April Fool's Day.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, beer. My one weakness. My Achilles heel, if you will.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whew! It's a good thing that beer wasn't shaken up any more, or I'd have looked quite the fool. An April Fool, as it were.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So thirsty... Eh. What're you gonna do?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmmm... beer.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,Shhhh! Just watch.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, ahh. Ha! Got him!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay. This time I'll just go into the bushes over there, make a lot of noise and flush out a rabbit. When he comes out, you step on him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The burgers are getting cold, guys. Holy moly.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks for coming to visit me, Moe.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No! No! Beer bring pain!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge, what if I wind up as some vegetable, watching TV on the couch? My important work will never be completed.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What a lovely surprise! You're here to see me, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Tell him I'm going to the back seat of my car with the woman I love. And I won't be back for ten minutes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Oh. Well, thanks for your time.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No. Let me hear you play.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Does a father have to explain? Let's just share your gift, okay?",,,,,

Homer Simpson,They're fine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, come on. You're gonna learn how to shave.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...and, finally, the little spot under your nose. Next, we take some toilet paper, tear off some teensy little squares, and stick one there, and there, and any place you're bleeding. There and there. Don't worry, the blood will hold it right on your face. Now, some aftershave.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ah! Ooh! Arg! Son of a -- ! Ah! And that's how we shave.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why, you little --",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This calls for a celebration. We're all going to Hawaii!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gotcha! It's April Fool's for two more minutes!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Me lose brain? Uh-oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why'd I laugh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, it happened again!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I ate those fancy soaps you bought for the bathroom.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I never graduated from high school.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I never passed remedial science one ""A"".",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"I don't know. I flunked Latin, too.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, my high school yearbook...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You handsome devil.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't believe I ate the whole thing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Activities, none. Sports, none. Honors, none."" So many memories.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It'll be great to see the old gang again... Potsy, Ralph Malph, ""The Fonz""...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, they weren't all happy Days. Like the time Pinky Tuscadero crashed her motorcycle -- or the night I lost all my money to those card sharks, and my Dad, Tom Bosley, had to get it back.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, there's Bobby Mindich, the class clown.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Richard Nixon.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll bet you'd trade it all for one night with my wife.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Homer's not here, man.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ed Sullivan.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my God!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I discovered a meal between breakfast and brunch.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What can I say? It hasn't been easy staying in my rut...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I have my pride. I'm going to go to night school, earn my high school diploma, and get back my most improved odor trophy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, Lisa I have something to tell you, and I'm not proud of it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I never graduated from high school.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you have a job?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I see.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right. But if he starts to wig out, try to lure him into the cellar.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Will this be on the test?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nooooooo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is not happening. This is not happening.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,True.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,True.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,False.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, brain, you don't like me and I don't like you. But let's just do this and I can get back to killing you with beer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge! I passed!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,At our next high school reunion I'll have nothing to be ashamed of.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, Dondelinger.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey kids. How was school?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's my boy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mmmm, beer... What?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No son of mine is gonna be a 19th Century Cockney bootblack. We're gonna find you another school.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, it's too late. The boy's ten years old! Let's focus our energy on Lisa and the other one.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's your problem?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! The greatest day of the year.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Maybe so, Lisa, but it's part of our oh-so-human nature. Inside every man is a struggle between good and evil that cannot be resolved.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look what I got, Marge. A new whacking stick.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whack!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whack! Whack! Whack!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just squeeze your rage into a bitter little ball and release it at an appropriate time. Like that day I hit the referee with a whiskey bottle. Remember that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Your Daddy hit the referee.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Here you go. Official Whacking Day parking. Ten dollars per axle.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, Marge,",,,,,
Homer Simpson,should I whack slow or fast?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, maybe if I'm part of that mob, I can help steer it in wise directions. Now, where's my giant foam cowboy hat and air horn?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You mean there's a better way?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Gotta get a juicer. Gonna drink juice, lose weight. Won't get chest pain from answering the phone anymore.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my Juice Loosener's never gonna come.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo-Hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My name is Mr. Burns.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, the boy's wasting valuable time -- come change the channel and pat my head.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But, I'll miss ""Sheriff Lobo.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll miss Sheriff Lobo...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll miss Sheriff Lobo...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lobooo...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lobooo...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, Marge, I'll just talk to Apu and I'm sure he'll be reasonable.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Apu, I'd like you to drop the charges against my wife.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, come on! I'm your best customer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmm... pie.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm gonna miss you so much. And it's not just the sex... it's also the food preparation... your skill with stains of all kinds. But mostly, I'll miss how lucky you make me feel each and every morning.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, please. I'm having enough trouble with the lobsters.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now kids, while your mother's gone, I don't wanna have to wash any dishes. So, from now on, drink straight from the faucet or milk carton, and we'll eat while standing over the sink or toilet.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We're gonna let her roam free in the backyard, and nature will take its course.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Go up to the attic. There's a whole trunk of clothes up there.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... no.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Honey, I don't know what you're feelin' right now. So I don't wanna push anything. We can just hold hands... or sit and talk...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He's dead now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I figure it's some guy's name. Some guy named Gabbo.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll figure it out. I'm gonna use all the power of my brain.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He'll tell us what to do.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,WITH MY...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Two wrongs make a right, Lisa. Ah, Rex Morgan M.D., you have the prescription for the daily blues.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Moe, can I look too?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My wallet's in the car.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, you can stay with us until you lose that weight. You can sleep on the sofa, it folds right out.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, wait. That was the old sofa.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, delicious.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, five cents each!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Junk... junk... the airplane's upside down... Strad-i-who-vius?...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm surprised you don't remember, son. It was only eight years ago.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Who cares? Anyway, it all happened during that magical summer of 1985... A maturing Joe Piscopo left ""Saturday Night Live"" to conquer Hollywood... People Express introduced a generation of hicks to plane travel...and I was in a barbershop quartet...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hello...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Every afternoon at Moe's, Chief Wiggum, Principal Skinner, Apu and I would get together and sing... and the crowds went wild.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, what did I tell you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Rock 'n' roll had become stagnant. ""Achy Breaky Heart"" was seven years away. Something had to fill the void, and that something was barbershop...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,GOODBYE...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,SO GOODBYE...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just leave it to me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Run along, boy. You're free now!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The next day, we started auditioning for Chief Wiggum's replacement...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get off the stage!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It was one lousy applicant after another. And then...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Barney, how'd you like to sing for our group?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The Be Sharps.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What'd you kids get?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Far out, man. I haven't seen a bong in years.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, one of us made some money. I sold a guy our spare tire.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It'll be a long time before your Mother gets back with the tire, so why don't I tell you more of the story? Now that we had a name, the Be Sharps needed a hit. Something new, something exciting, something mid-1980's...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,THERE WAS NOTHING IN AL CAPONE'S VAULT / BUT IT WASN'T GERALDO'S FAULT --,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmm... baby on board.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"BABY ON BOARD / SOMETHING, SOMETHING BURT WARD... This thing writes itself!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait'll I tell Marge!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well... if I explain it to Marge that way, I'm sure she'll understand.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, honey. It'll only be till we finish our tour of Sweden.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but I'm not gonna let it change our lives. I'll be the same loving father I've always been.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I stuck him somewhere.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look what I got for you, Dad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We'd like to dedicate this next number to a very special woman. She's 100 years old, and she weighs over 200... ... tons.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I meant the statue.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We had fame and fortune.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now all we needed was the approval of record company low-lifes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then came the greatest thrill of my life.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my God. Oh my God! Where did you get that brownie?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh man.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, did you see the Grammys?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, you haven't heard the last of them.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I miss you too, honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh. Thanks.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"They took the foam off the market because they found out it was poisonous. But if you ask me, if you're dumb enough to eat it, you deserve to die. Bart!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,All the time. It was the title of our second album!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But we were about to learn an iron law of show business: What goes up must come down.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, anyway, we were all getting tired of--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shut up!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hi, kids... I love",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Meanwhile, the group was having problems of its own...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I pity the fool who doesn't like... he. And wher's Barney?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then came the day we knew we were finished.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are we hot?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We all went our separate ways.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, fellas! I'm back.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll give her a good home.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I did.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll never forget my five-and-a-half weeks at the top.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There are perfectly good answers to those questions, but they'll have to wait for another night. Now off to bed.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'd like to thank you on behalf of the group, and I hope we passed the audition.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my god, someone's trying to kill me! Oh wait, it's for Bart.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh. I wrote that one, after Bart somehow put this tattoo on my butt.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's probably the person you least suspect!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If you don't mind, we're trying to watch the mov...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh no!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Is that so? Oh, Flan-ders! Won't you join me in my kitchen?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Go home.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Woo hoo! Did you hear, Bart? Oh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ooh! I wanna be John Elway.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whup, two against one!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This isn't just because of Sideshow Bob. It's a chance to turn around all our stinking lives.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Shut up, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, Ice Creamville.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Check.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I got ya.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No problem.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think he's talking to you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,EVERYTHING IS A SOURCE OF FUN...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lousy speed bumps.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ew. This coffee's too hot.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, kids! Wanna drive through that cactus patch?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, a houseboat! You know, the great thing is if you don't like your neighbors, you can just pull up the anchor and sail someplace else.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I tied him up, out back.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Relax, Marge. I tied up all the loose ends before we left.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Aaah...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart! Don't interrupt!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh it is not.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,BARTDOYOUWANTSOMEBROWNIESBEFORE YOUGOTOBED?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, let me cut you a brownie while they're still hot.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why? Oh, right. The Sideshow Bob thing. Sorry, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nope.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,BARTDOYOUWANNASEEMYNEWCHAINSAWAND HOCKEYMASK?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry. What am I thinking?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, a plan fiendishly clever in its intricacies.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, no fair.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, geez, I told you, Bernie. To guard the bee.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You guys are pathetic. No wonder Smithers made me Head Bee Guy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The bee bit my bottom. Now my bottom's big! Oh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the hell are you talking about?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What do I do!? What do I do!? In the name of God you've got to tell me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just poke blindly at the controls until they let you go.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Must destroy mankind! Ohh, lunch time.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So you want me to go to college?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Maybe you're right. I did always want to go to college, but fate stood in the way.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That dog has somebody's ham! This I gotta see!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon! Gimme the hand, you stupid dog! C'mon! Gimme' that!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Is ""TV Guide"" a book?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Son of Sniglets??,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Katharine Hepburn's ""Me""?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I suck.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,... it was the most I ever threw-up and it changed my life forever.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks boy. Now, for the crowning touch...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Relax, a photo can't make any difference.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, son, but there's a program about campus life that I really should watch.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I hate that lousy dean!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes! Take that, Bitterman!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! A flyer for a hardware store!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Something I should have done a long time ago...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, ma'am.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Woo hoo, I'm a college man! I won't need my high school diploma anymore.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I AM SO SMART/ I AM SO SMART/ I AM SO SMART/ I AM SO SMART. S-M-R-T...I MEAN S-M-A-R-T.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My first day of college. I wish my father was alive to see this.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How long have you been back there?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nerd!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, try to understand. There are two kinds of college students: jocks and nerds. As a jock, it is my duty to give nerds a hard time.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey pal, did you get a load of the nerd?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll be a campus hero...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, someone's squeezed all the life out of these kids. And unless movies and TV have lied to me, it's a crusty, bitter, old dean!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, I can't wait to take some of the starch out of that stuffed shirt.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hold me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You see that, sir. Drops his notes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do we have to?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then kiss my curvy butt goodbye!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but this is what they're doing on campus. Besides, it isn't costing us - I swiped the cinderblocks from a construction site.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, excuse me ""Professor Brainiac,"" but I worked in a nuclear power plant for ten years and uh, I think I know how a proton accelerator works.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, I will.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"In there, guys.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, you've won this round, Dean. But the war isn't over.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, Dean? You're a stupid head.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hiya, gang!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, I'm supposed to get a physics tutor...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Heh heh. ""Nee.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We played Dungeons and Dragons for three hours. Then I was slain by an elf.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You take that back...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really? But nerds are my mortal enemy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, not Souter... Oh, no.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll write it on my hand...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon guys, look at yourselves. All you do is study. I'm gonna show you the true meaning of college!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We're gonna go out and par-ty!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aah, the college road trip. What better way to spread beer-fueled mayhem?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, we're college guys and we're up to no good...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm telling you, a big crazy prank is just what the doctor ordered. The Dean'll go nuts!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I got it! We wait by his mailbox, and when he comes outside, we roll him up in a carpet and throw him off a bridge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Those bastards...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And then we roll him up in a carpet and throw him off a bridge.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look! You pull its tail straight and it curls right back up again. Curly, straight, curly, straight, curly, straight, curly, straight...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Of course he does. He's a cute little piggy. Curly, straight, curly, straight, curly...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow! Why you little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Guys, believe me, I didn't mean to get you expelled...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, that's not the wallet inspector.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, they don't have anywhere to stay, and they're geniuses. They'll solve all our problems. They'll elevate us to the status of kings on Earth.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, I'm sure we can work something out where we can all live in harmony. Right, Marge?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Absolutely. Now the only antidote to a zany scheme is an even zanier scheme.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I got it! We're gonna fix it so you guys save the dean's life.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Perfect.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, dean, I'm really sorry for the running-you-over prank.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And all those other pranks were my idea too. I'm the one who should be expelled.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, you have.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No problem, guys. The important thing is that we wrapped up all the loose ends.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Exam?!? Oh, this is just like one of those bad dreams.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Actually, I've been working on a plan. During the exam, I'll hide under some coats and hope that somehow everything will work out.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whatever. Either way is good...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm gonna lose my job just 'cause I'm dangerously unqualified.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Computers can do that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mora wuza?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, let's just say I had help from a ""little magic box...""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, the important thing is that we all learned a lesson. These guys learned the richness and variety of the world outside college.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh. Then I learned the real value of college is to study and work hard.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmmm, true.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge. You're worse than that crusty old dean.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I guess it's back to college for me. And that means it's time to... What did I teach you guys?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lobo! Lobo! Bring back Sheriff Lobo! Lobo! Lobo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh no! Burns' Birthday!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Every time Mr. Burns has a birthday all his employees have to help out at the party. And I always get some terrible job.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow. Ow. Ow. Missed me. Ow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not funny. And the one in my pants really hurt.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hee hee! I'm so funny! This is gonna be great.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm writing a delicious send up of Mr. Burns for his birthday party. Is poo poo one word or two?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I also do a delightful impression of him. I paint a frownie face on my butt and pull down my pants.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now I'm not saying Mr. Burns is incontinent...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, don't spoil our fun!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, stupid!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, the comedy roast is an American tradition. It's what gives us the freedom to criticize our social betters. Hey Flanders, you smell like Manure!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you ready to laugh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I said are you ready to laugh?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, Mr. Burns is so cheap...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I mean... you know... Mr. Burns... is so... old...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, tough crowd. Better bring out the big guns. Here's an impression of Mr. Burns that you might find... a little cheeky.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm Mr. Burns. Blah, blah, blah. Do this. Do that. Blah, blah, blah.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I think I'm so big. Blah, blah, blah.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Blah, bla...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Unghhhh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, where did I lose 'em? I'll never wiggle my bare butt in public again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, boy. He'll be ready for your Aunt Selma's birthday.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Maggie, I'm trying to watch TV. Put that moldy old bear down.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Moldy!?! Old!?!... I'm gonna get something to eat!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Right. That makes sense.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No! Lemme go!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How long have we had these fish? Wait! The bear! Burns' bear!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, Burns isn't gettin' this back cheap, I'll tell you that. He's going to have to give me... my own recording studio.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Two all-beef patties, special sauce lettuce cheese pickles onions on a sesame seed bun...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes. We'll send the eye.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes sir. Reject the first offer. Reject the first offer.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Burns. No deal.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I gotta call Burns! I gotta call Burns. Maybe I can still get that drink!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I knew you'd come crawling back.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A million dollars and three Hawaiian Islands. Good ones, not the leper ones.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! I'm rich! Rich I tells ya. Here you go.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It seems to be stuck. Bad baby! Bad Maggie!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here you go, Maggie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The deal's off, Mr. Burns. The bear stays here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, big deal. Who needs his money? We're gettin' by okay.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,I think I'm blind.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Right here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My life can't get any worse.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,After lunch can I whip you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Maggie, I know you like the bear... but wouldn't you be just as happy playing with... this box!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,See Maggie? See the fun box! Do do do do doo do...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do do do do doo...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No! My box! My box!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you must hate me for not taking Mr. Burns' money.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw thanks, Marge. But it'll take a lot more than that to comfort this tortured soul.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Box...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can see why this is so popular.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's right.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Barney, leave me alone.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh, it's about the same. Uh-oh! Look out, Smithers!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I love this show,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well well, look whose come to apologize.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But Mr. Burns, it's not my bear. It's Maggie's.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, we didn't get any money, but Mr. Burns got what he wanted. Marge, I'm confused. Is this a happy ending or a sad ending?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, pure genius...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh. Pure genius. And now to make the leap from dreams to reality.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right. Stay calm. Remember your training.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dear Homer, I.O.U. one emergency donut. Signed, Homer. Bastard. He's always one step ahead. Oh, I'd sell my soul for a donut!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Flanders! You're the devil?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do you have a donut or not?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, wait. If I don't finish this last bite, you don't get my soul, do you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm smarter than the de-vil! I'm smarter than the dev-,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not likely. Heh, heh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmmm... forbidden donut.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh, that wasn't so bad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, huh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,More. Mmmm.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Ow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But I'm so sweet and tasty. Well, time to go to work.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, look at all this great stuff I found at the marina! It was just sitting in some guy's boat!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey boy!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,They're dogs! And they're playing poker!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Heh-heh-HEH. Lisa, vampires are make-believe. Just like elves, gremlins and Eskimos.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmmm... business deal.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It sure was nice of Mr. Burns to invite us for a midnight dinner at his country house in... Pennsylvania.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sure did.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, his hairdo looks so queer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It was the boy!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Huh, ooooh, punch!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Correction. Free blood.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ahhh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Lisa, you and your stories. Bart is a vampire, beer kills brain cells. Now let's go back to that... building... thingee... where our beds and TV... is.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart! How many times have I told you not to bite your sist... Wait a minute! You are a vampire.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Kill my boss? Do I dare live out the American Dream?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Super Fun Happy Slide!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I guess killing will be fun enough.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Take that, vile fiend!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, sorry.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You have to kill the head vampire.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the hell's so funny?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid TV. Be more funny.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Heh, heh, some idiot actually called in!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, it's public TV! They never have anything good. Where are the Geraldos? Where are the Eubankses-es?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The ballet? Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marjorie, please. I enjoy all the meats of our cultural stew. Ahhh, ballet.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, but remember it's mine.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's what ballet is?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, yeah, yeah just give me the serum.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Heh, heh, heh. It was worth it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't. I gotta take my wife to the ballet.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmmm... invisible cola.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Heh, heh. Time to stick it to the man.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Phht, that's just an old wives tale.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Errrrghh... just...a little more. Got it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm stuck! Help me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Must... get to ballet...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,promised Marge...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hello? Can I get some help? Snack related mishap!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mmmmm, candy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, this may be hard to believe, but I'm trapped inside two vending machines.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm going to have these things on my arms forever!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Candy and sodas for all!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmmm... convenient.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"They'll grow back, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Your point being?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I know you didn't believe me about the vending machines. That's why I had the fireman write me a note.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lumber has a million uses.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, that's twice. I think you're spending entirely too much time with this woman.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I got sprayed by this skunk! Oh look, it's doing it again!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you can't go out on Saturday. That's our special night.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What the... Oh, I don't know... a little show called ""Doctor Quinn, Medicine Woman""?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where you going?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,When will you be home?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where you going?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Will you bring me back something?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"How can you do this, Marge? How can you desert your children?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man's best friend, indeed.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't believe your mother went out to have fun without me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that would be delightf... Quiet, boy! There's nothing to feel ashamed of here. Women have a right to a night out. Right, Lisa?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's it! I'm calling my buddies. Marge is not the only one who can have a girls' night out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine! I can have a great time all by myself!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Lisa, haven't you seen ""Home Alone?"" If some burglars come, it'll be a very humorous and entertaining situation.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait a second...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You kids do need a baby-sitter.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Here you g... Nnnnnno.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We pay eight dollars for the night and you can take two Popsicles out of the freezer.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Two.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Done.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sometimes you gotta go where everybody knows your name.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hi guys!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe, get the darts. I want to play.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooooh, ""Jet!""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! It's Garret Morris' birthday.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Come on Marge. It's fun to smash things. I smashed it good!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You got real purdy hair.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, young love.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The old make-out place. Hey! A new weather station. I'll bash it good!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's just no fun without Marge.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My wife's having a girls' night out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I miss you, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A lot of blue hair? Heh-heh. What a freak.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's Marge! She's become a crazed criminal, just because I didn't take her to the ballet.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's them!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my God. They're gonna drive right into it just to teach us men a lesson. And it's all my fault!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge! Marge!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, Marge, I'm sorry I haven't been a better husband. I'm sorry about the time I tried to make gravy in the bathtub. I'm sorry I used your wedding dress to wax the car... And I'm sorry... Oh well let's just say I'm sorry for the whole marriage up to this point.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But please Marge, don't drive into that chasm!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Solid waste, I could kiss you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mmmmm... Ewwww.... Mmmmm...Ohhh... Mmmmm... Ahhhh. Ooh, I think this was pizza.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Heh. Heh. Stupid animals.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ahh, the daily newspaper.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oooh! The Springfield Men's Shelter is giving away sixty soiled mattresses!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,OH MY GOD!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Tram...Ample...Een! Tram...Baple...Een!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh no, you don't! That trampoline is MINE.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Krusty!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah. What's the deal?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I can just haul it away? Free?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hi, son. Hi, son. Hi, son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, it's the perfect exercise. It'll double the value of our house. And it was free. FREEEE!!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Absolutely! And this is just the beginning! I've got some big plans.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No it doesn't!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kids, kids, once you get hurt, move aside and let other people jump.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay. I'll take care of it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, all right! I'll get rid of the trampoline!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Krusty! I'm bringing back the...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,There we go.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's the last I'll see of Mr. Trampoline.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yep, it's finally gone.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If this were a cartoon, the cliff would break off now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm thirsty.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Checkmate, Mr. Trampoline.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, all right, you win for now, but some day you'll rust.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Rust I tell ya.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-huh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, the trampoline was a bad idea. But you know what? At least I'm out there trying new things. If it were up to you, all we'd ever do is work and go to church!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Name one thing you've done in the past month that was fun.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's not fun!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"See, Marge?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What up, Marge?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, can I go outside and play?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And that sends me into a shame spiral.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm feeling a lot of shame right now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I feel that you hear my shame.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I feel validated by that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Me too.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow! For free, ""SURPLUS DRUMS OF MAYONNAISE FROM OPERATION DESERT STORM.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Marge, you and I are fine now. Who needs Brad Goodman?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, here we are at the Brad Goodman lecture.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I just thought I'd remind everybody. After all, we did agree to attend his self-help seminar.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It sure does!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thank you. Very, very much.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is great. I can finally look like I want and not get hassled by the man.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I hear ya, buddy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, boy! In here!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hold on, son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So long, suckers!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, we're not.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah... boy, if only Bart had been a better role model for everyone.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's what I've been saying. We're all fine the way we are.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, it's that new show about the policeman who solves crimes in his spare time.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, McGarnigal. Eases the pain.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It means he gets results, you stupid chief.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'm sorry.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, finally a little quiet time, to read some of my old favorites.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Honey roasted peanuts. Ingredients: salt, artificial honey-roasting agents, pressed peanut sweepings."" Mmmmm.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Steak?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Steak?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ah! The last peanut - overflowing with the oil and salt of its departed brothers.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh oh. Something's wrong.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ow, pointy. Eww, slimy. Uh-oh, moving. Ah-ha!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, twenty dollars. I wanted a peanut.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Explain how.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmmmm... free goo.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, don't discourage the boy. Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It's what separates us from the animals. Except the weasel.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well if it isn't the leader of the wiener patrol, boning up on his nerd lessons.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're right, Marge. Good work, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Egghead likes his bookie wook!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just tucking him in.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, floor pie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmm.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,BART!!!! Mmm... apple.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dah, I am the captain. My son is Bart.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"How was jerk practice, boy? Did they teach you how to sing to trees and build crappy furniture out of useless wooden logs? Huh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid poetic justice...!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Heh heh. You don't have a son.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't want to go, so if he asks me to go, I'll just say yes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Shut up, brain, or I'll stab you with a Q-tip.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, I'd be delighted to go on your trip with you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll take it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Please not Flanders. Please not Flanders. Please not Flanders.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You are not my son.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, I dunno. But lucky for you somebody here is responsible.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, there's a new Mexico.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So many Krustyburger locations.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wrong again, Flanders.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"In a situation like this, you just relax and let the current take you back to land.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,SUGAR. DO DO DO DO DO DO AWWW. HO--NEY. HO.....NEYYY. DO DO DO DO DO DO. / YOU ARE MY CANDY GIRRRRL Lousy piece of junk!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now I have to face stupid reality again!... Flanders! My socks feel dirty! Gimme some water to wash 'em!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh pardon me, Mr. Let's Ration Everything, but what do you think we're floatin' on? Don't you know the poem? ""Water, water everywhere/ So let's all have a drink.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ohh... What does it matter? We're doomed!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Woo-hoo! See that, boy? Your old man was right, not Flanders. We are doomed! In your face, Flanders!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, since you're all such a bunch of big ration-babies, I'll just be in charge of the rationing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Observe, boy. The secret is to take tiny bites, like so:",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why couldn't I be on one of the smart rafts. I bet they're having the time of their life.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This ain't one of your church-picnic flaregun-firings, Flanders. This is the Real Thing...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, well that's okay. When they come to rescue him, they'll rescue us.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Flanders! Snap out of it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's better to be safe than sorry. Sorry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You'll thank me when we're frying up a big juicy fish.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He'll be back.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here fishy, fishy, fishy. We're waiting.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, there's something I was gonna give you at the end of this trip, but since we may not survive, I want you to have it now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I stole it from that Borgnine guy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thanks boy. Now be careful when you...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The foul stench of death is upon us. Mmmm... hamburgers.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,According to this map there's a Krustyburger on an offshore oil rig!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Never mind the fog! That way. Steer! There isn't much time!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Give seven hundred Krustyburgers!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Go away. Eating.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Watch this, guys.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And we won't be able to pee in the drinking fountain.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I mean... you know if we wanted to... not that I... ever did.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hi.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gotta go.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the hell was that? I probably shouldn't have eaten that packet of powdered gravy I found in the parking lot.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah. Another day, another box of stolen pens.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You too. No goose bumps. No hallucinations. That last time was just a fluke.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So uh, what do you guys think of Mindy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah. That Mindy seems real nice.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mindy has a motorcycle.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe, I need your advice.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"See, I got this friend named... Joey Joe Joe Junior... Schabadoo.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, what the hell, it's me. I'm attracted to another woman. What am I going to do?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Barney. That is so insightful. How did you come up with that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, so. Let's have a conversation. Uh, I think we'll find we have very little in common.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, my favorite, raspberry swirl with a double glaze.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, so we have one thing in common. But you know what I hate? Drinking beer and watching TV.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Me too.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Foul temptress! I'll bet she thinks Ziggy's gotten too preachy, too.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I made it the whole day without seeing her again.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I mean hello!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's okay. I'll just push the button for the stimulator, I mean elevator.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's unsexy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ew.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, this is my floor.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Arr - see ya tomorrow.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, home to my loving family. What more can a man ask for?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uhhh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hi, son. Howya... ewww.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, good.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Let's have a little quality time together, just you and me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey! We haven't watched TV in awhile.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hello hotline? I am very tempted by another woman.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nooo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who are you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sir Isa-who?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Col. Klink! Did you ever get my letters?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hee, hee, hee, hee. Did you know Hogan had tunnels all over your camp?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, I would live in a big mansion?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I, as well. Are you happy, Jeeves?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then we're all happy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge lives here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"OH MINDY, YOU CAME AND YOU GAVE WITHOUT FLAKING. BUT I SENT YOU BEN-GAY, OH ANDY, YOU KISSED ME AND STOPPED ME FROM SOMETHING, AND I...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um, because I have a small role in a Broadway musical. It's not much, but it's a start.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Like what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, look out behind you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, Lisa, I swear to you. I'm one-hundred percent completely serious. You've got to turn around right now before it's too late.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sucker.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mindy, because of our uncontrollable attraction, I think we should avoid each other from now on.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mindy!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh no! I'm sweating like Roger Ebert.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, Murphy, you are elf a controllably I think a we nam- myo-renge-kyo.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, this is the worst crisis my marriage has ever faced. Colonel Klink, why have you forsaken me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Heh heh heh. Did you know Kinch had a radio in the coffee pot?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stop that. I love my wife and family. All I'm gonna use this bed for is sleeping, eating, and maybe building a little fort. That's it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Free mouthwash! Free shampoo! Free shower curtain!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mindy?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah. Uh, walls are a necessity in today's society. Heh heh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Mindy, we have to fight our temptation.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh. Something's missing. Ooh, one of the turkeys fell behind the bed.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmmm... foot long chili dog.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's a sign!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Go to hell!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Heh, you know, I was a little worried about coming to this convention with you, but I think as long as we're not alone together...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is there any way to get out of this?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well I guess you'll want to come in.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, yeah.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah. Like you don't know. We're gonna have sex.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes we do. The cookie told me so.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But they're so sweet.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, maybe I want to. But then I think about Marge and the kids well not the boy, he drives me nuts. Sometimes I'd just like to...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, baby.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmmm... Marge.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"OH, MARGIE, YOU CAME AND YOU FOUND ME A TURKEY, ON MY VACATION AWAY FROM WORKEY...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, there's something you don't see in a toilet every day.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Anybody lose their glasses? Last chance. Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining sides.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, just because you're ten feet tall doesn't mean you can tell me what to do.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And you know what the best part is? We've really done something for the children.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shhh. I'm trying to teach the baby to gamble.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I got a job at Burns' casino. As you know, it's been my lifelong dream to become a blackjack dealer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We got more gongs than the break-dancing robot that caught on fire.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, let's see... 18... 27... 35. Dealer busts. Looks like you all win again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why thanks, Senator! Oop, looks like my shift is over.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Marge, after your big tantrum against legalized gambling, I bet it feels pretty weird to be in a casino.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Strike three, Marge. I remember that meeting, and I have a photographic memory.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Y'ello?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And then I said to the president... get this Marge? Marge?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Twenty- one? Do that card-counting thing again! Come on. Do it again.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No! Please, please, please, please, please...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you waited for me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, Marge, let's go.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm taking the car.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This late? Through the bad neighborhood?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait. I see what's happening here. You're just mad because everyone in this town loves gambling except for you. Well, that's just sad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You've gotta improvise, Lisa. Cloves, Tom Collins Mix, frozen pie crust.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, come on, Lisa, there's no reason to... Let's go see Mom.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, we need to talk. You're spending too much time at the casino, and I think you may have a problem...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Problem solved!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh? Wuh? Lisa? What's up?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, sure... you just lie down and tell me all about it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Boogeyman?! You nail the windows shut! I'll get the gun!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, I don't want to alarm you, but there may be a Boogeyman or Boogeymen in the house!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, nothing, Marge. Just a little incident involving the Boogeyman. Of course, none of this would've happened if you'd been here to keep me from acting stupid.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Aw. Just like on TV.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, your mom still loves you. It's just that she has a career, now. She's a slot jockey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's always something isn't it? First, I have to drive your pregnant mother to the hospital so she can give birth to you, and now this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow...ow...ow...ow.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah, the costume.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, Floreeda.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, Lisa. The only monster here is the gambling monster that has enslaved your mother. I call him Gamblor. And it's time to snatch your mother from his neon claws.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge! Where are you?! Damn this casino! Damn this casino!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can't talk now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You broke a promise to your child.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You promised Lisa to help her with her costume. You made her cry, then I cried. Then Maggie laughed. She's such a little trooper.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I want you to admit you have a gambling problem.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No no, that's too expensive. Just don't do it anymore.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can't talk. Robbed. Go hell.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, Marge, for the first time in our marriage, I can finally look down my nose at you. You have a gambling problem.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh sure... Remember when I got caught stealing all those watches from Sears?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, that's nothing, because you have a gambling problem! And remember when I let that escaped lunatic in the house 'cause he was dressed like Santa Claus?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, you have a gambling problem!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, what a gyp.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And remember when I...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah. I forgot already.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh, that's no big loss.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you've probably got a whole drawer full of 'em.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Shhh, quiet Lisa.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Curse you, Magic Beans.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, police? Are you sitting down? Good. I wish to report a robbery!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let me check my reason list.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yep. It's on here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Alright, these are our new family security rules: Be home before dark, and make sure you're not followed, lock all doors and windows.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, they're only human.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Lisa, stop pining for your saxophone. I got you another instrument.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, never, ever stop in the middle of a hoe-down.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, honey. I didn't realize how much that horn meant to you. Don't worry. Daddy's gonna get it back. I don't know how, but I'll figure out something.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know Lisa, music helps daddy think.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I dunno. Can you swing a sack of door knobs?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm someone else!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We don't need a thinker, we need a doer. Someone who'll act without considering the consequences.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Dad. You're too old.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, Dad, you've done a lot of great things, but you're a very old man now, and old people are useless. Aren't they? Aren't they? Huh? Yes they are. Yes they are...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, we're responsible adults and...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,... and if a group of responsible adults can't handle firearms in a responsible way...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, we've got the secret vigilante handshake. Now we need code names. I'll be ""Cueball."" Skinner can be ""Eightball"", Barney will be ""Twelveball,"" and Moe, you can be ""Cueball.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, we're forming a vigilante group.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Put this in your pipe and smoke it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo Hoo! Woo hoo hoo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Woo hoo, hoo! Take that Maynard G. Krebs!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, men, it's time to clean up this town.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, push people around, make ourselves feel big.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, give me that megaphone of yours.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Never mind the commercials. Just give it to me. I've got to whip this neighborhood into shape.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Move along there.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Return to your homes and places of businesses!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey you, where'd you get that saxophone?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get him!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No burning leaves without a permit!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Too late.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You better have a good reason for doing that, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're in. Here's the sack.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So I said to him, ""Look buddy, your car was upside down when we got here. And as for your Grandma, she shouldn't have mouthed off like that.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I 'unno. Coast Guard?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, the mob is working on getting your saxophone back, but we've also expanded into other important areas.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Literacy programs... preserving our beloved covered bridges... world domination...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that might be a typo.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, people can come up with statistics to prove anything, Kent. Forty percent of all people know that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Kent, I'd be lying if I said my men weren't committing crimes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Y'ello.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... Marge?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you monster! And you have my daughter's saxophone too!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh sorry. I'm a little nervous.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen, Mr. Cat Burglar, I vow to go without sleep and guard the Springfield museum day and night for as long as it takes, from now on unless you want to taunt me more by giving me an approximate time.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We'll be right back.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dad, the best way for you to help is to set a good example. Just stand around and don't steal anything.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He'll show.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's his job.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He's a burglar.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, Mr. Cat Burglar, you'd like to get in here, wouldn't you? There's just one little problem. Thirty-six years ago some lady gave birth to a man named Homer J. Sim -- Oh my God! Underage kids drinking beer without a permit!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Asleep at the switch! I wasn't asleep! I was drunk!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, no matter what the paper says, I still have a job to do.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nooooo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, this doesn't work any more.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I didn't say stop.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, Dad, I could kiss you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No wait! I know where the burglar is!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, Mr. Molloy. It seems that the cat has been caught by the very person that was trying to catch him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Actually, it wasn't me. It was my Dad, Grampa.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I caught the cat burglar. I caught the cat burglar. That means you. You are the cat burglar.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shut up.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No kidding.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I guess I'll be going to my home now and... sleep.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lemme through! I gotta find a Big T. There's millions of dollars buried under a Big T!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's mine!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Frightfully sorry, but there is no hidden treasure. I have already used this time to escape from your jail. Fondest wishes."" Oh, I can't make out this signature.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We'll dig our way out!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ahh, the morning horoscope. ""Today will be a day like every other day."" It just gets worse and worse.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, you kids gotta go to school. I gotta go to work. The only one who has it easy is Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Buzz off, Giuseppe.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just a minute! Don't hang up! Y'ello... you'll have to speak up, I'm wearing a towel.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What do you mean you lost him?! He might have fallen into one of these machines!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my God! That's his lucky red hat!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He's a box! My boy's a box! Damn you! A boooxxx!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I have some horrible, bone chilling news.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, nothing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's not a job. It's a waste of time. What can poor people pay ya? Nothin'! What satisfaction do you get from helping 'em? None! Who wants to help poor people anyway? Nobody!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why not? I remember my first after-school job. I was in a band.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, everybody. I'm Archie Bell and I'm also the Drells. We got a new song called, 'Tighten Up' and this is the music you tighten up with.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, son, you can have an electric guitar, just like your old man.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Gig, son. When you're a musician, a job is called a gig.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's okay, son. Who cares what a bunch of fourth graders think? You're doing what you want to do with your life. Nothing else matters.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yep, well, that's what got me where I am today.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There, there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ah. Oliver North. He was just poured into that uniform.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, Lisa. Say something funny.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, something stupid like Bart would say. Bucka bucka or woozle wozzle. Something like that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, don't worry, son, they said the same thing about Urkel... that little snot. Boy I'd like to smack that kid.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the hell are you readin' books for?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't forget to say ""I didn't do it"".",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How do you figure boy?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, but after Leno I'm all laughed out you know.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That dog can sell anything.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What kind of catchphrase is that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Cheap meat!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, this one's open!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, stomach churning... Bowels clenching... Not much time. Must finish.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Your old meat made me sick!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This shrimp isn't frozen and it smells funny.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ooh. Rancid meat attack. Stupid parasites. Is there no way I can find justice?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bor-ing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Shhhh, Lisa. The dog is barking.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No way, man No way, man. Get yourself another patsy, man. No way am I wearing a freakin' wire.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that I'll wear.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't be alarmed, Apu. Just go about your daily routine like I'm not wearing the hat.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bee? Aah!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,One hot dog please.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's true, it's true. We're so lame.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, don't kill me! I didn't know there was film in that camera in that hat! I was unaware! I WAS UNAWAAARE!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're selling what now?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You can't sell that. Karma can only be portioned out by the cosmos.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is he still out there?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What? That's your job. If he starts doing Lisa's wood chopping...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay I'll let him. But then I get a chipwich, okay?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stop being such babies. You can't be afraid to try new things. For instance, tonight I'm using a... Apu, what do you call this thing again?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Outrageous.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, I like to keep a lollipop there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pass the chutney.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's even worse than the album Grampa released.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well you deserve it. All these vegetables are really clearing the cholesterol out of the old heart.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ub. Apu friend me good.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,THAT KWIK-E-MART'S A REAL... .,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Everything really wrapped up nicely. Much quicker than usual.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And we've all found happiness... Every one of us.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's that sound?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, he's not happy at all. He lied to us through song. I hate when people do that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm coming with you. I got you fired, it's the least I can do... Well, the least I can do is absolutely nothing. But I'll go you one better and come along.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm aware of that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are we in India yet?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are we in India yet?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are we in India yet?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are we in India yet?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This isn't very convenient.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you really the head of the Kwik-E-Mart?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well that was a big bust... is he really the head of the Kwik-E-Mart?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No need to apologize, Apu. It was as much my fault as it was yours.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, Apu, I accept your apology.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fine. Oh, I mean not good.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Apu, if it'll make you feel any better, I've learned that life is one crushing defeat after another until you just wish Flanders was dead.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, let's all hug Apu.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, there's still time. Let's hug him again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dad, we'd love to stay here and listen to your amusing antidotes, but we have to take these coins to the mall and spend them.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, Maggie! It's Sgt. Thug's Mountaintop Command Post, complete with Death-bringer missiles that really launch!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, come on, Marge, you're way too...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"ONE, TWO, THREE O'CLOCK, FOUR O'CLOCK ROCK. FIVE, SIX, SEVEN O'CLOCK, EIGHT O'CLOCK ROCK!..",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"ROCK! ROCK! ROCK! ROCK-A, ROCK, ROCK! ROCKAROCKROCK!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"WE'RE GONNA ROCK, GONNA ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK TO-NIGHHHTTT!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thank you, thank you very much!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, that's what I bought it for!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes. But there's more.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dad, I love you, but: you are a weird, sore-headed old crank and nobody likes ya.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And we can't watch Fox 'cause they own those chemical weapons plants in Syria.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm a white male, aged eighteen to forty-nine. Everyone listens to me! No matter how dumb my suggestions are.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How about me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'unno.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, Lisa, Lady -- If you'll excuse me, I've got something very important to attend to.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello. Well, today's the day for Homer J. I know I'm gonna win this time.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Union rule twenty-six - ""Every employee must win worker of the week at least once, regardless of gross incompetence, obesity, or rank odor.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Inanimate huh? I'll show him inanimate!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid carbon rod. It's all just a popularity contest.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nobody respects me at work.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What, what does it say? I want to see.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, TV respects me. It laughs with me, not at me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Boring.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, the batteries!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Make it stop!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't! I can't!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, is this NASA?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good. Listen, I'm sick of your boring space launches. Now I'm just an ordinary blue collar slob, but I know what I likes on TV...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shut up. And another thing - how come I can't get no Tang 'round here? And also... hold on a second.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, is this President Clinton? Good. I figured if anyone knew where to get some Tang it'd be you... shut up!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No. It wasn't me, I swear. It was... him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Respect?! Nooo! It was me! I made the crank call. I do it all the time. Check with the FBI, I have a file. I HAVE A FIIIIILE.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll field this one. The only danger is if they send us to that terrible Planet of the Apes. ...Wait a minute, Statue of Liberty... That was our planet. You maniacs! You blew it up! Damn you! Damn you all to hell.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll take care of this.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And may the best man win. He's got a big drinking problem - could embarrass the program. Meet me up in that tree later and I'll tell you more.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Less shame?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who's doin' what now?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well here I am, right on time. I don't see Barney ""Let's-crash-the-rocket-into-the-White-House-and-kill-the-President"" Gumbel.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, that's nothin'. Watch this. There once was a man from Nantucket",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't stands no more.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmmmm. Mediciney.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ahem... I uh... don't think this contest is over yet, Buzz. If that is your real name. I believe there Is still a little something called the swimsuit competition.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You mean I shaved my bikini zone for nothing?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Congratulations, Barney.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Default? Woo hoo! The two sweetest words in the English language. De-fault! De-fault! De-,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nooooo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I don't really want to go through with this... But being an astronaut is how I got you to respect me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ants!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're right, Marge. Just like the time I could've met Mr. T at the mall. The entire day, I kept saying, I'll go a little later, I'll go a little later.' And then when I got there, they told me he just left. And when I asked the mall guy if he would ever come back again, he said he didn't know. Well, I'm never gonna let something like that happen again. I'm going into space, right now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are we there yet? I'm thirsty.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's beautiful. It's the most awe inspiring sight I have ever seen.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"... giver of life, mother of us all.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey guys, look what I smuggled aboard.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow! Former president James Taylor.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And that is that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute Race! Wait a minute. Wait!...Ah-ha! Now I'll bust that pretty face of yours.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid bar.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll bash you good.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"OH, THOSE GOLDEN GRAHAMS/ OH, THOSE GOLDEN GRAHAMS/ CRISPY CRUNCHY GRAHAM CEREAL BRAND NEW BREAKFAST TREAT.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"See because of me, now they have a warning.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Sold!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What do you mean? It says right here: ""Free wig with every purchase of large wig. Downtown Wig Center."" Why you little... Hmmm... Free wig.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I love you, Homey. Heh, heh, heh. I don't need her at all anymore.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Heh-heh-heh, I did it. Second in line and all I had to do was miss eight days of work.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"In theory, yes. Jerk.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get tickets. Must get tickets. Find phone. Yes!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh stupid sheep.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not Flanders. Anybody, but Flanders.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'VE GOT TWO TICKETS TO PARADISE / I'VE GOT TWO TICKETS TO PARADISE...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Excellent guitar riff.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why am I such a loser? Why?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Heh, heh, heh. Yeah they swore they'd get us back by spiking our water supply. But they didn't have the guts.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"God, if you really are God, you'll get me tickets to that game.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why do you mock me, oh Lord?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I know I shouldn't eat thee but... Mmmm... sacri-licious.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Y- No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Flanders, I decided I'd like to go to the game with you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, yeah.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Duck! I can't let the boys see me with you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hi.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey everybody, here comes fun!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Heh heh. Ow.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I guess I should pay my share...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, you brought me a nacho hat. Thanks, Ned.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"NACHO, NACHO MAN / I WANT TO BE A NACHO MAN.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If anyone can pull it off, it's Stan ""The Boy"" Taylor.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We won! We won! Flanders, we won!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Losers! Losers! Kiss my big Springfield behind, Shelbyville!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I am invincible! Invincible!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, somebody sign an autograph. Please, somebody!? Sign an autograph. Hey, would you sign... You fat, stupid jerks!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It was him!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You know Stan Taylor?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Professional athletes. Always wantin' more.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, thanks. Now I have four children. You will be called ""Stitch-face."" Wow, Flanders, this is about the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No! I want everyone to know that this is Ned Flanders... my friend!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, quit livin' in the past.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll be there. And this time you can be the nacho man.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Watch this, Ned. They don't call me Springfield Fats just because I'm morbidly obese.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now you got a law suit on your hands. Just kidding.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Boring. Let's watch something else.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey what gives? I thought you had a satellite dish.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, Uncle Homer. Ned, since you've let me spend time with your family, I want you to get to know my family.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey everyone!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'd like to introduce Ned Flanders, my best friend.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can't talk... see Flanders... later sex.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hiya, Flanders! Oooh... dinner! May I join you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah. A judge made me do that once, too. Stupid lack of public urinals. Hey, just so you don't have to suffer alone, I'm comin' with ya.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But... all right.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,C'mon! We've been here for fifteen minutes. Can't you see they're sucking the life out of us?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, for some reason, Moe's is always closed on Wednesdays.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, come on, just give 'em the slop and lets get out of here. Oh, I can do it faster that that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh of course you'd say something like that, Marge. You've hated Ned for years. In fact, you wanted to bash his head in with a pipe.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Love, Marge. Don't hate. Love.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The Flanderses are not geeks! Okay, Rod and Todd are... and the wife has a thing for me, but she hides it behind a mask of low key hostility. But we've got to give this thing a chance. I want the two families to take a trip together this weekend.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes way.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, I brought my Rappin' Ronnie Reagan tape. It always makes the trip go faster.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ha, ha. You know something, he did say 'well' a lot.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"More. No, no, keep comin'. More... more... right there! Let her go!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, let's go boating!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They're fine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'd like to propose a toast to the coming together of the Simpsons and the Flanders. If this were a more perfect world, we'd all be known as the Flimpsons.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, here's to my best friend, Ned.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Food fight!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whatcha doin'?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay. But at least let me take the boat out for one last spin!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Too late.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Humph, your car. Boy, what are the odds, huh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge! I think I hate Ted Koppel. No wait, I find him informative and witty. 'Nite.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's up for today, Neddie?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Right, no reporters.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,O-okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Neddie, Neddie... Let's get in a quick nine down at the pitch and putt.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Neddie? NEDDDDIEEE!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmmm. Guess he didn't see me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Flanders, over here. I got us some kick-ass seats.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I live to give.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! How dare you talk about Ned Flanders like that! He's a wonderful, kind, caring man. Maybe even more so than me. There have been times when I've lost patience with him, even lashed out at him. But this man has turned every cheek on his body. If everyone here were like Ned Flanders, there'd be no need for heaven. We'd already be there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Right back atcha, buddy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now how 'bout that game at the Pitch 'n Putt?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Guess what, everyone?! My great uncle Boris died and left us his old country house. There's only one catch they say - it's haunted. But I'm sure we can prove him wrong by spending the weekend there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Get lost, Flanders.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"See, I told ya. There's nothin' to worry about. This place isn't...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hi, Mom.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'd love to honey, but Daddy has to go to a beer drinking contest today.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose. It's how drunk you get.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Push her down, son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh dear God, no.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I call the basement.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All done.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Are you mad, woman? You never know when an old calendar might come in handy. Sure it's not nineteen eighty-five right now, but who knows what tomorrow will bring? And these TV Guides... so many memories.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Gomer upsets Sergeant Carter."" Ooooh, I'll never forget that episode!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shazam.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's the point of all this cleaning? Are we so vain?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Use only in a well ventilated area.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Shove it, buddy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nothing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Y'ello.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Y'ello?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He's taking the elephant instead of the money.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Heh, heh. Stick it to the man. No, wait!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We'll call you back! Bart! With ten thousand dollars we'd be millionaires. We could buy all kinds of useful things, like... ... love.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, go to your room.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wee!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Heh, heh, it does look like Al Gore.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I agree with you, in theory. In theory Communism works. In theory.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's he yelling about?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maybe if we tied it down so it couldn't move it wouldn't get so hungry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, everything's cruel according to you. Keeping him chained up in the backyard is cruel. Pulling on his tail is cruel. Yelling in his ears is cruel. Everything is cruel. So excuse me if I'm cruel.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now I've had my head in an elephant, a hippo and a giant sloth.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shut up.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Plants, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, any more arboretums around here?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That bird! He's killing the elephant! Stop him!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Grooming him, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I know. He's grooming me. Mmm... elephant fresh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's with them?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh. Good luck. Look at these bills. ""Chain for elephant,"" ""Shots for elephant""... ""Oversized decorative poncho"".",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well these bills'll have to be paid out of your allowance.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Then that's what I'll do, smart guy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"For the ninth time, no!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute, this gives me an idea.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't have time to read. Just give me the gist of it, son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Your kid flew five feet. That counts as a ride. Two bucks.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look at this, Marge! Fifty-eight dollars! And all of it profit! I'm the smartest businessman in the world!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, please don't humiliate me in front of the money.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um, Milhouse saw the elephant twice and rode him once. Right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, that was under our old price structure. Under our new price structure, your bill comes to a total of seven hundred dollars. Now, you've already paid me four dollars, so that's just six hundred and ninety-six dollars more that you owe me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This town is full of deadbeats. We can't afford this elephant.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Bart. I'm gonna have to sell him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What do you mean? It's an elephant, isn't it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,He likes peanuts.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I only have two questions. How much, and give it to me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, your bid is zero.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thank you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thank you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, a guy who has lots of ivory is less likely to hurt Stampy than a guy whose ivory supplies are low.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, son. I'll get you a new elephant.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Done.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Here's the keys.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll just keep these then.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He took Bart too?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That wasn't part of our deal, Blackheart! That wasn't PAAAAART!!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Piece of cake. All we have to do is follow the path of destruction.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid tornado. look. It got Patty and Selma.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Elephant, honey. It's an elephant. And I'm sure he'll make a grand piano.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, you're okay! And you've led us to the precious ivory. And of course your lovable pet, who it's connected to...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Forget it. That elephant cost me thousands of dollars.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'd like it fine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, of course I would. Who wouldn't like that? To be part of the Music Scene...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nah, that's okay. I'm pretty sure I can struggle my way out. First I'll just reach in and pull my legs out.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now I'll pull my arms out with my face...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm alive! I'm alive. And I owe it all to this feisty feline.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I guess it wouldn't be right to sell Stampy after he saved my life. And, the boy seems to have some sort of relationship with him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"On the other hand, who's to say what's right these days... what with all our modern ideas... and products.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right. We'll give the stupid elephant to the stupid animal refuge.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmm. Caramel.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lousy job. Nothing exciting ever happens.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! What do I get?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, this isn't such a great prize. Oh, well, this may be a dirty job, but the big guys at the top work even harder.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's it, boy. You're our last hope.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, boy, I wrote down exactly what to say. Just read it and you're a shoo-in.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oooh. He card reads good.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's KURNS, stupid!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Disregard.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The boot kicked Bart. It kicked him right in the butt.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There sure is. Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. Right in the butt. That was great.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Woo hoo! We're rich! Bart, get over to the mansion and open up all the windows. We want to get the old people smell out before we move in.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Huh? Oh, right. So I guess you're in okay shape, huh? No heart problems or anything...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Boo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah. So good...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, let's push him down the steps.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How come Bart gets to do that and I can't spend one night lurking in the bushes outside Chef Boyardee's house?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay. Lisa quit getting in the way of your wealthy brother's peas.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That was the end piece. That's it! Being abusive to your family is one thing but I will not stand idly by and watch you feed a hungry dog. Go to your room!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, you listen.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My secret shame.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, you're coming home.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Or what? You'll release the dogs? Or the bees? Or the dogs with bees in their mouths, and when they bark, they shoot bees at you? Well go ahead, do your worst.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,He locked the door! I'll show him.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You idiot! He was the most talented one!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Can I keep him anyway? Huh, huh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, the trail of donuts ended. Bart!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll miss you, son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, I know you're upset because you thought you saw us on TV saying we didn't want you in our family. But those were just actors playing us.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Because one of them hung out with me for a week trying to get my character down.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Right back atcha, son. Aw.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And now I want you to meet your new brother, Hans Moleman.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Give it a try. It's like kissing a peanut. Heh, heh, heh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, let me get this straight. They let everybody out of school early, just because you brought a dog?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm off to work.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, dogs can never have enough excitement.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look! Ree, ree. Ree, ree. Aye, aye. All right, all right, I won't take the dog. C'mere.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"How many ""s""'s in ""innocent""?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That is true.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't let the boy see me skipping work.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"How do you do, sir?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sucker.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Jury duty. I'll see that Quimby kid hang for this.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know you can read my thoughts, boy. Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow/ meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, fine.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What does sequestered mean?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What does deadlocked mean?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh-huh. And ""if""?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So ""if"" we don't all vote the same way, we'll be ""deadlocked"" and have to be ""sequestered"" in the Springfield Palace Hotel.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Where we'll get... a free room, free food, free swimming pool, free HBO - Oooh, ""Free Willy!""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, how are the rest of you voting?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm only doing what I think is right. I believe Freddie Quimby should walk out of here a free hotel.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I miss you too, Marge. But the law needs me. I'll be home as soon as I can.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Room service? Send up two more pot roasts and three more pillows with mints on 'em.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shut up.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Jump, Free Willy, jump! Jump with all your might!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't like this new director's cut.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Got it, Barn?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm not stealing it. Hotels expect you to take a few things. It's a souvenir.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Souvenir.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, Marge, it was horrible. Everyone was against me in that jury room. But I stood by the courage of my convictions and I prevailed. And that's why we had Chinese food for lunch.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Great, Marge. I wanna hear all about it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Maggie, can you point to the monkey?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pfft. What do babies know?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What? It's not Magaggie's birthday? Oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ooh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Or, if not then, Christmas.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hee, hee, hee, hee. That is funny.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, please. Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied, so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not at all.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm opposed to the whole thing! Damn opposed!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If he marries your mother, Marge, we'll be brother and sister! And then our kids, they'll be horrible freaks with pink skin, no overbites, and five fingers on each hand!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dad, that will never work. If you want to make your move, you've gotta play it... cool.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"NOW, WHAT YOU GOTTA DO / IF YOU WANT TO GET A KISS / IS ACT REAL SMOOTH / AND MAKE YOUR MOVE LIKE THIS.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,NOW WHAT'S THAT RULE?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dad says this new guy is a repulsive, obnoxious old billionaire, so let's all be extra-nice to him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yabba-dabba-doo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's right, money. Your money's happiness is all that moneys.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Woo hoo! Three hundred fifty dollars!! Now I can buy seventy transcripts of ""Nightline""!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ew yuuuuck!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Barney, why don't you fill out the groom's side.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whew. Don't try to eat these so-called ""chips.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh? Oh. Okay. I'll take three.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I mean, woo hoo!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I was bluffing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How dare you call me that?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, anyhoo, last night, we're playing poker, right. As usual, I'm winning and not realizing it. And Lenny says that I'm uh... get this... ""A little slow.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How come you're not laughing? Do you think I'm slow?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You think I don't want to? It's those TV networks, Marge. They won't let me. One quality show after another. Each one fresher and more brilliant than the last. If they only stumbled once -- just gave us thirty minutes to ourselves. But they won't, they won't let me live!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, who am I kidding? I am slow...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Take another bath in malt liquor?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, and how is ""education"" supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home wine making course and I forgot how to drive?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And how.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute, even Lenny is teaching a class. Look at the way they admire and adore him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's it! If he can teach a class, he can teach a class. I mean, I can teach a class.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well... I can tell the difference between butter and ""I Can't Believe It's Not Butter.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've failed again. Everybody can teach a class but me. I'm an idiot. What am I gonna tell my wife and kids?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That depends. Is there another way to get this job?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, everyone! Now that I'm a teacher, I've sewed patches on my elbows.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Incorrect, Marge. Two perfectly good jackets.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, Lisa. Daddy's a teacher.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Can't talk now, Flanders. I've got a class to teach.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nothing for me, today! I've got a class to teach!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's all right! I'm a teacher.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, the first thing they told me to do is make sure everyone here is in the right class.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Down the hall, room twelve.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ew. Okay, let's get started.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No talking.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, yeah. That'll eat up some time. Uh, how 'bout you, Otto.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Huh? Yeah, I was listening. Very funny.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, yes, yes. To the untrained eye I'm eating an orange. But to the eye that has brains, I am making a point about marriage. For you see, marriage is a lot like an orange.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"First you have the skin, then the sweet, sweet innards.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay. But then we've got to get to work.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I told Marge this wouldn't work the other night in bed.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, that's not what I meant. Marge and I always talk things over in bed. Like the other night we were fighting about money.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I was telling Marge that we could save some money if she only dyed her hair once a month.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah. She's been gray as a mule since she was seventeen.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I went on for hours and they were hanging on my every word. I really think I was born to teach.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, Marge. Let me in! There's crickets out here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I didn't tell 'em personal stuff.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you mean about you. All right, maybe I said some things -- some personal things. But, you should have seen 'em, Marge. They really wanted to hear what I had to say.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, Marge, you don't know what it's like. I'm the one there everyday, putting his ass on the line. And I'm not out of order. You're out of order. The whole freakin' system is out of order. You want the truth? You want the truth? You can't handle the truth. 'Cause when you reach over and put your hand into a pile of goo that was your best friend's face, you'll know what to do. Forget it, Marge - it's Chinatown.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes ma'am.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now what is a wedding? Well, Webster's Dictionary describes a wedding as: 'The process of removing weeds from one's garden.'",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This is a place of learning, not a house of... hearing about things.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, wait! Uh, uh, wait!... I, yes! I do have a story about two other young marrieds.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, the wife of this couple has an interesting quirk in the bedroom. It seems she goes wild with desire if her husband nibbles on her elbow.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well let's just call 'em uh, ""Mr. X"" and ""Mrs. Y."" So anyway, Mr. X would say, 'Marge, If this doesn't get your motor running, my name isn't Homer J. Simpson.'",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not tonight, Marge. Tonight we can eat a nice, leisurely dinner at home.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you'll never guess what. My whole class is here. They're going to observe the human peep show that is our lives.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, little Lisa, apple of my eye. How are things down at the ol' schoolhouse?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And how's my little major leaguer? Catch any Junebugs today?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, I know you meant well, but that wasn't the right thing to do.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, now that the little ones have toddled off to bed...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, we're breaking early tonight, class. For tomorrow, you should read pages seven through eighteen in Lisa's diary.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I'm not in the cla...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, Marge, things were said, mistakes were made. Let's end this madness and get on with our lives.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But, I learned my lesson. It'll never happen again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, Marge is throwing me out for blabbing about her elbow thing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Honey, the door blew shut! Oh. Fine. That's what you want? You got it. This scene is gettin' old, man. I'm hittin' the road. Maybe I'll drop you a line someday from wherever I wind up in this crazy old world.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't mind me boys, just scrubbing my undies.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Keep up the rough-housing, son. Without a strong male presence in the house, you could turn sissy overnight. Oh, these stubborn grass stains.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, good, Reverend Lovejoy will make Marge take me back. He has to push the sanctity of marriage or his God will punish him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good night, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why didn't I take a picture? I had ten years to take a picture.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I love you... Will you marry me, Marge?... You mean I'm gonna be a daddy?... I hope we'll always be together... together... together...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Together?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good news, Lisa. I don't need your mother anymore. I've created a replacement that's superior to her in almost every way.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, you will respect your new mother. Now give her a kiss. Kisss herrr.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"OhmyGodohmyGodohmyGod. All right, let's get our stories straight. She tripped, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, your flesh mother used to bring me pudding. Oh, I miss Marge. Lisa you're smart. Help me trick her into taking me back.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll pay you forty dollars if you think of it for me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, thirty.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, brain. It's all up to you. If you don't think of what it is, we'll lose Marge forever.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe, what are you doing here?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bye, Moe!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I figured out what I can give you that no one else can.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A bouquet of po...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I give up. I don't deserve to live with you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My tattered rags are caught on your coffee table.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute! Wait, that's it! I know now what I can offer you that no one else can. Complete and utter dependence.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Are you kidding? It's a wondrous, marvelous thing. Marge, I need you more than anyone else on this entire planet could possibly ever need you. I need you to take care of me, to put up with me, and most of all, I need you to love me, because I love you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, look at me! We've been separated for a day, and I'm as dirty as a Frenchman. In another few hours, I'll be dead. I can't afford to lose your trust again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's great to be indoors with my family.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, this is dated two weeks ago.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Special present?! I don't wanna wait! I want it now! I want the children to see. Oh. Right. Later.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Moe!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's cool in here, boy. For the rest of the summer, we can live inside the refrigerator.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I got the idea when I noticed the refrigerator was cold.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, can you set the oven to cold?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, Lisa?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I understand. Let us celebrate our new arrangement with the adding of chocolate to milk.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, The Tinkler. I like the sound of that. We'll take it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, everybody in the pool!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is it a pool yet?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry boy, when you get a job like me, you'll miss every summer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah...There's nothing like rising with the sun for a quiet, peaceful dip in your very own pool.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,YAAARR--Ewwwwwww!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa! The Blob has got me! Don't touch me, or he'll get you too!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Chlorine, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmmm....,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But why? She's such a fox. I mean, what's on Fox tonight? Something ribald, no doubt.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You see, Marge? You see?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not everything. There's still the little matter of the whereabouts of your wife.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I see. Then everything is wrapped up in a neat little package. Really, I mean that. Sorry if it sounded sarcastic.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, stop the racket. I'm trying to fix your mother's camera. Now easy... easy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hm, I'm gonna need a bigger drill.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're steerin' fine, boy... Hard to the right!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hard to the left!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cat!... Deer!... Old Man!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Jackknifed sugar truck. Sugar?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, buddy. Here's a quarter. Call for help at the nearest phone... I'll keep an eye on things here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We hit the jackpot, here! White gold! Texas tea... sweetener.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Read your town charter, boy. ""If food stuffs should touch the ground, said food stuffs shall be turned over to the village idiot."" Since I don't see him around, start shoveling.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's because I've loaded it with sugar!!... Marge, our ship has come in! I found five hundred pounds of sugar -- in the forest -- that I'm gonna sell directly to the consumer. And all for a low, low price of one dollar per pound.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Those are prizes. Ooo, a blasting cap!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sugar Man!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And you didn't think I'd make any money. I found a dollar while I was waiting for the bus.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! A four day weekend!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Must... protect... sugar... Thieves everywhere... The strong must protect the sweet... the sweet,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"In America, first you get the sugar, then you get the power, then you get the women.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Huh, wha?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh am I, Am I really?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A-ha!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, pal. Where'd you get the sugar for that tea?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Never! Never, Marge! I can't live the buttoned-down life like you. I want it all: the terrifying lows, the dizzying highs, the creamy middles. Sure I might offend a few of the bluenoses with my cocky-stride and musky odors. Oh, I'll never be the darling of the so called ""City Fathers"" who cluck their tongues, stroke their beards, and talk about what's to be done with this Homer Simpson.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey! Get off my sugar! Bad bees! Bad!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ow! Ow! Oh, they're defending themselves somehow!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bees are on the what, now?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Deal!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nooooooo! My sugar is melting! Melting! Oh what a world!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh sugar!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's okay, Marge. I've learned my lesson. A mountain of sugar is too much for one man. It's clear now why God portions it out in those tiny packets and why he lives on a plantation in Hawaii.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Like what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh? Wuzz wrong? House run away? Dog's on fire?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, it's three a.m. and I worked all day!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There you are. Thought you could get away, huh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmmm.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hm...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mmmm, Chocolate... / Mmmm, invisible cola. / Mmmm, Forbidden donut. / Mmmm sacrilicious. Mmmm, / Mmmm, free goo. Mmmm, something.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, okay.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I want you to stop seeing this Jacque. You can let him down gently. But over the next couple of months, I want you to break it off.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, that was a close one, kids.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, Marge. As long as we're traumatizing the kids, I have a scandalous story of my own.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hi.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gotta go.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I made it the whole day without seeing her again.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I mean hello!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's okay. I'll just push the button for the stimulator, I mean elevator.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's unsexy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ew.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, this is my floor.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,See you tomorrow....,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I tried to avoid her, but we were sent to a nuclear convention in Capital City together...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stop that. I love my wife and family. All I'm gonna use this bed for is sleeping, eating, and maybe building a little fort. That's it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Mindy, we have to fight our temptation.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Go to hell!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I was doing my best to resist her...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But at dinner, the fortune cookie predicted doom.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, yeah.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah. Like you don't know. We're gonna have sex.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes we do. The cookie told me so.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But they're so sweet.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, baby.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,She hit the bottle pretty hard and lost her job.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute, Marge. Love isn't hopeless. Look, maybe I'm no expert on the subject. But there was one time I got it right...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shut up. I'm over as far as I can go!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, all right! I'll walk in the mud!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sure.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who? Oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, pour vous.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I've got a problem. Once you stop this car, I'm gonna hug you and kiss you and then I'll never be able to let you go.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But not the last.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, everything's too damned expensive these days. Look at this Bible I just got. Fifteen bucks! And talk about a preachy book! Everybody's a sinner except for this guy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No no no no no no no no no. Ask your mother.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,TV Town! Hammock Land!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Embarrassed? What are you talking about?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, look Marge! They're still not fightin' back! I can be a jerk and no one can stop me! Hee hee hee hee!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Suckers.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shark-boy!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lobster hat... Fishnet Speedo, Jr... Wheelie Shoes... invisible dog leash. Well, I'm packed.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, let's make a pact. This is gonna be the best vacation ever, or we all agree to disband and join other families.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, the Interstate. Fasten your seatbelts, kids. We're on our way to Itchy and Scratchy Land!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, I've got an ace up my sleeve.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Omigod! What'll I do? What'll I do?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The whole trunk's full of 'em, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, to absorb some local color through the magic of AM radio.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't mind if I do.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We don't need to do that, Marge. I'm not tired. I'm not tired at all.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"North. ""South."" Nuts to this! I'm going to take a shortcut.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Trust me, Marge. With today's modern cars you can't get lost. What with all the silicon chips and such.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, we're here. Let us never speak of the shortcut again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now remember, we're in the Itchy Lot.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,One adult and four children.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, okay. If it's fun. Let's see...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll take eleven hundred dollars worth.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Eyeball stew.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh look! It's the twelve noon robot parade! Hurry up or we'll have to wait for the twelve-oh-five parade.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Parents Island?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It is the '70s! Right down to the smallest detail!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thank you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I kicked one of those stupid Itchy characters in the butt.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, I was a political prisoner.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I kicked a giant mouse in the butt. Do I have to draw you a diagram?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey look, this one's coming on to me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yoo hoo, Mr. Robot...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, don't contradict your elders.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My hair! You chopped off my hair! Oh God I'm ugly!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Back you robots! Nobody ruins my family vacation but me. And maybe the boy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What're you, the narrator?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Die, bad robots, die! With a dry, cool wit like that I could be an action hero.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But there are five of us.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's better.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh, guys. Now, I'm not very political -- I usually think people who vote are a bit ""fruit-y"" -- but, for some reason, this Birch Barlow really speaks to me...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"When I'm driving the car, I get to choose the radio station. When you're driving, we'll listen to your radio station.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't take this anymore. Let's switch back.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, ma'am. Sideshow Bob. Yakkin' it up on the ol' yak-box.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Phew.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-huh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Sideshow Bob.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's the Rapture! Quick, get Bart out of the house before God comes!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmm. I don't agree with his Bart-killing policy, but I do approve of his Selma-killing policy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know what you're up to, Mayor Terwigajer. And no one in my family's gonna stand for it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We're gonna lose our house and end up living under a bridge like common trolls.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stuck-up Riverdale punks. Think they're too good for me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Mr. Smithers!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, it was a long trip, but we're almost there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, it's been two long trips, but we're finally almost there, again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,John Denver.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hm, cable's out... Think I'll have a beer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hm, not a drop in the house. What do you know?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll kill you! I'll kill all of you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, sorry. Don't worry, there's plenty I can do to keep myself occupied. Maybe I'll check out that axe collection. See ya later.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Moe! Give me a beer!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why should I kill my family?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You don't look so happy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, what do you think, Marge? All I need is a title. I was thinking along the lines of ""No TV and No Beer Make Homer..."" something something.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Gimme the bat, Marge. Gimme the bat! Gimme the bat! C'mon, gimme the bat. Gimme the bat ba-bat!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Heh-heh. Scaredy-cat...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can't murder now. Eating.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Noooo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Heeeeere's Johnny.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Daaaa-vid Lettermaaaan!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm Mike Wallace. I'm Morley Safer. And I'm Ed Bradley. All this and Andy Rooney tonight on ""60 minutes.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Must kill family. .,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Television! Teacher, mother, secret lover.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Urge to kill fading, fading...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fading... Rising!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...Fading, fading, gone.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come, family, sit in the snow with Daddy and let us all bask in television's warm glowing, warming glow.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can't. Frozen.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Urge to kill rising.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Y'know, Marge, I've had my share of troubles but sitting here now with you and the kids, in our cozy home in this beautiful, free country, it just makes me feel that I'm really a lucky guy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get it off! Get it off! Get it offf!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This shouldn't be too hard to fix, with the right tools.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,There! Better than new! Now to take her for a test toast.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the-?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look at that! I'm the first non- Brazilian person to travel backwards through time!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've gone back to the time when dinosaurs weren't just confined to zoos. OK. Don't panic. Remember the advice your father gave you on your wedding day...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fine. As long as I stand perfectly still and don't touch anything, I won't destroy the future.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid bug. You go squish now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But that was just one little insignificant mosquito. That can't change the future, right? Right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Phew. I'm back.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, my loving family. Nothing's changed.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what the hell is that geek Flanders doing on TV?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the hell are you smiling at?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nooooo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh no! They're gaining on me. Wait, I have an idea.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,These wieners will give me the quick energy I need to escape.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I gotta go back... Fix future...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This time I'm not gonna touch a thing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mustn't crush. Mustn't kill. Made it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I wish I wish I hadn't killed that fish.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, where is everybody?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is gonna cost me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I mean, Heeeyy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmm. Fabulous house. Well-behaved kids. Sisters-in-law dead. Luxury sedan. Woo hoo! I hit the jackpot. Marge, dear. Would you kindly pass me a donut?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't touch anything?!! I'll... touch... whatever... I... feel like!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What's my name?! What color is the sky?! What of donuts? WHAT?! For the love of God, tell meeeee!!!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nothing. Nothing at all. Let's just eat.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Eh. Close enough.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh oh, it's seeping in! Stupid cheap weather stripping.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I can't believe my little boy is already going on his first date. SUNRISE, SUNSET / SUNRISE, SUNSET / CAT'S IN THE CRADLE AND THE SILVER SPOON / YES, WE HAVE NO BANANAS!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, it's not that. Didn't you hear? They have no bananas. They have no bananas today.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,New glasses?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Probably misses his old glasses.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, and then we'd get the chair.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It was, Marge. Admit it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh good, here comes the collection plate.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We can spare it, Marge. We've been blessed.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stop him! He's headed for the window!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, if you can look me in the eye and say you didn't take the collection money, that's all I need.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little... How can you look me in the eye and lie like that?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Tell me, if he didn't take the money, why is he wearing those fancy clothes?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooo, how convenient.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"See, son? Telling the truth isn't so bad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,To the little girl's room!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I like those odds.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whew, that's all of 'em. And I'm so proud you didn't try to forge my name. How 'bout a present, son?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Done and done.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, the mysteries of life.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sports, sports, sports, sports. Sports, sports, sports, sports. Marge, Bart rides up in the front seat today because he's a good guy at sports.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I mean my little girl buddy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I tried.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, son, just remember to have fun out there today, and if you lose, I'll kill you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well boy, you won. So I'm gonna live up to my side of the agreement. Here's your turtle, alive and well.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, if the Bible has taught us nothing else, and it hasn't, it's that girls should stick to girl sports, such as hot oil wrestling, foxy boxing, and such and such.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh! Ooh my - oh, the hell with it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, hotshots, now that my daughter is on your team, I want to make a few things clear.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't want anyone to give her a hard time just because she's different. No jokes, no taunting... Look! That kid's got bosoms! Who's got a wet towel?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come here, you butterball.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We're laughing with her, Marge! There's a big difference.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,With her.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, little buddy, hop in!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, hon.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sucker. Competitive, violent, that's why you're here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, sorry Bart, Lisa and I are going out for gelato. We'd ask you to come but, you know...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, eye of the tiger, mouth of a teamster. To think of all the time I wasted on you... uh, well, not wasted... I love you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Quiet down, Bart!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay. All right, pie, I'm just gonna do this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And if you get eaten, it's your own fault.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey! Apu just called. This Friday Lisa's team is playing Bart's team. You're in direct competition. And don't go easy on each other just because you're brother and sister. I want to see you both fighting for your parents' love.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pass the ketchup.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I asked for ketchup. I'm eating salad here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe, what are you doin' here?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now that we're all alone, Marge, admit it. You like Lisa best.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, so you're a Bart woman, are you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, you can't possibly like Maggie best. What has she ever done? Nothin' for nobody!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hi kids!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I love Bart!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, wait! I love Lisa!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Beer. Oh, Marge, I love you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my God, Marge. A penalty shot, with only four seconds left. It's your child versus mine! The winner will be showered with praise, the loser will be taunted and booed until my throat is sore.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,They're both losers. Losers!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You like sweets, kids? I know a place that's sweeter than sweetness itself. In this sweet place, earthly donuts are sour as poison. You'd spit them out! You would! I'm talking about the Candy Industry Trade Show. .",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They hid them in every millionth Krusty Klump bar and Krusty Klump bar with almonds.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry kids, but this is one event I want my darling wife by my side.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ma-arge. They can't carry enough candy. They have puny, little muscles, not big, ropey ones like you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They wouldn't be if you were willing to sit in a hollowed-out wheelchair.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hurry, Marge. If we get there early we can get our pictures taken with the two surviving Musketeers.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I feel like a kid in some kind of a store.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Brilliant... exquisite ...ooh, you'll do well... Gimme those, etc.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmm hmm. Keep going.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oooh -- gummy bears. Gummy calves heads. Gummy jaw breakers.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What dat?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Must have rare gummy. Distract the salesman Marge!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, this is going to take all my skill.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Run, Marge! Save the booty!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"See you in hell, candy boys.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Relax, Marge, there's plenty for her to do in there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"See, she's having the time of her life.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, a graduate student, huh? How come you guys can go to the moon but you can't make my shoes smell good?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nobody's blaming you. Hey, could you take the wheel for a second? I have to scratch myself in two places at once.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Precious Venus...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, kids. Lots of candy left for breakfast.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh no! The candy conventioneers tracked us down!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,For a minute there I thought I was in big trouble. It's just a...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I swear I didn't touch her. You know how bashful I am. I can't even say the word ""titmouse"" without giggling like a schoolgirl.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh that. No. I was just grabbing a gummy Venus de Milo that got stuck to your pants.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, I'm a decent guy...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well Lisa, remember that post card Grampa sent us from Florida of that alligator biting that woman's bottom?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's right, we all thought it was hilarious. But it turns out we were wrong. That alligator was sexually harassing that woman.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, that's kind of a gray area.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, kids.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Do your worst, protesters you can't stop me from living my life!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's okay, they're with me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"They're ruining my whole life. Marge, please, this is where I need you the most. I'm counting on you to do something or say something to make it all better. Okay-- go.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You mean, I'm on my own? I've never been on my own. Oh no! On own! On own! I need help. Oh, God help me! Help me, God!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Y'ello?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmm, I saw that report you did on Sasquatch. It was fair and evenhanded. I'll do it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...Somebody had to take the babysitter home. Then I noticed, she was sitting on the gummy Venus so I grabbed it off of her. Oh, just thinking about that sweet, sweet candy. I just wish I had another one right now. But the most important thing is...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay. Say, can you introduce me to the Sasquatch? I like his style.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hee hee. Here comes the bouncing ball of justice!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Awww, crap!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"... Somebody had to take the babysitter home. Then I noticed she was sitting on -- her -- ""sweet can""! -- so I grabbed -- her ""sweet can""! Oh, just thinking about -- her ""can""! I just wish I had her -- ""sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet can""!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, kids, everything's gonna be just fine. Now go upstairs and pack your bags. We're gonna start a new life under the sea.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,UNDER THE SEA / UNDER THE SEA / THERE'LL BE NO ACCUSATIONS / JUST FRIENDLY CRUSTACEANS / UNDER THE SEA.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not with that attitude.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It didn't blow over, Marge. Nothin' ever blows over for me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, that's a half truth.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whaa?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, ""Portrait!"" Sounds classy... doesn't it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't have a friend in the world.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge. It's a miracle.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I need a hug.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How come you guys hesitated?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maybe TV is right. TV's always right.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you hugging the TV?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I like it better when they're making fun of people who aren't me. I know - ""Evening at the Improv."" They never talk about anything beyond the 1980s.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I wouldn't want to be Mr. T right now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But those shows all look so crummy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello. I am Homer Simpson, or as some of you wags have dubbed me, ""Father Goose."" You know, everybody believed the worst about me right away. Nobody cares that I didn't do it. But I didn't. Okay, look, I've done some bad things in my life, but harassing women is not one of them. Like, one time they were having this race with this stupid old-timey bicycles with the big wheel in front. So I figured, ""We'll see about that."" So I get this big chunk of cinderblock and I...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, gotta go. Innocent!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, this is so depressing. My only hope is this homemade Prozac. Hmm... needs more ice-cream.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Precious Venus...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thank you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're both right.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And Ted Koppel is a robot.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that man is sick!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But listen to the music. He's evil!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, my friend, I haven't learned a thing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let's never fight again.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Please, Marge. How often can I see a movie of this caliber on late-night TV?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No. It's just that I've only seen this movie twice before, and I've seen you every night for the last eleven ye-- What I meant to say is... we'll snuggle tomorrow, sweetie. I promise.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Enchiladas.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, there's just too much pressure... what with my job, the kids, traffic snarls, political strife at home and abroad... but I promise you, the second all those things go away, we'll have sex.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ooooookay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh. All right.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Marge! This guy looks like Apu!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes. And I am pursuing my interest in...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh. ""Mr. and Mrs. Erotic American.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,N -- -- yes. But please don't you say that word.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Faucet's jammed into my back... I'm stuck.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, the Pharaoh's Chamber has a vibrating sarcophagus.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, here we are. The ""Utility Room.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, honey, it's a romantic fantasy. I imagine I'm the janitor, and you're... the janitor's wife, who has to live with me in the utility room.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Never mind. You wouldn't understand.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're home safe. Done my duty. See ya the next time we need your signature.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Kids-here's-fifty-dollars-Why-not-go-to-the-movies-then-take-a-cab-to-your-Aunts'-house-Stay-there-Phone-call-you-later-Now-Now-Now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'll explain to you afterwards.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You want me to spend more time with dad? What about my New Year's resolution?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah... Where are my pants?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hoo mama! This is finally really happening. After years of disappointments with get-rich-quick-schemes, I know I'm gonna get rich with this scheme! And quick!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sir! Hello, Sir! Yes, you look like a man who needs help satisfying his wife!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ow. I guess people have some sort of ""moral objection"" to our sex-drug.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Great. I'm gonna be stuck in the car all weekend with that wheezy windbag.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That is correct.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,They didn't start chasing us until you turned on that getaway music.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ewww, why're we stopping at this dump?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow. Let's go find that hot dog tree I planted.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dad, how come you never gave me any encouragement? Maybe I could've been something more than I am, like a travel agent to a great scientist, or the inventor of a hilarious refrigerator alarm.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Your whole life, you never said one nice thing to me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're the screw-up!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right! That's it. We're goin' home. I'm sick of you and your stupid tonic!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Of course not Marge, just for the rest of his life. He said I was an accident. He didn't want to have me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know, but you're never supposed to tell the child.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But when I do it, it's cute.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kids, your daddy and his daddy are involved in a very sticky... nutty... chewy... chocolatey... Put it away, boy... situation. And your daddy has realized something very important: a father should always make his kids feel wanted. Starting right now, I promise to spend a lot more time with you and give you the attention you deserve.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dad!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son! My dear Son. From now on I'm going to be a good and attentive father. And for starters your ""old man"" is gonna teach you how to ride... your very first bike!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're no girl, you're a boy. A good boy. You can be president. Scratch that. You will be president.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think Lisa needs another push on her new tire swing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wheeee! Wheeee!!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,B-But I'm using my whole ass.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Some day you'll thank me for all this scary love! But now, I've gotta go somewhere and do some serious thinking.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Here's where it all started to go wrong. How'm I supposed to be a good dad when I never had one myself?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dad wasn't even around on Christmas morning when I actually got to meet Santa Claus. Some father... Wait a minute.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dad? This photo is a blessing. It eases my pain.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm a screw-up. I burned down our house.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You know what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We're both screw-ups.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So are you gonna say something nice now?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, Dad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm with you, Dad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is gonna to be great.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, come on, everybody. This bar is like a tavern to me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's Raining Men?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Jokes on them. I'm still alive.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can't.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm not going to dignify that with an answer.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes. Cris-a-tunity. You're right! I've been wasting my life away in that dump for years. That's it. I'm going to find a new bar to drink in. And I'm gonna get drunker than I've been in my entire life! Bart, where's my wallet?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thank you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, classy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmmm. This looks like a nice, friendly place.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute. There's something bothering me about this place. I know - this lesbian bar doesn't have a fire exit. Enjoy your death trap, ladies.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Gr-aargh! Oh my God, this man is my exact double. That dog has a puffy tail!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here, Puff! Here Puff!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The last bar in Springfield. If they don't let me in here, I'm gonna have to quit drinking.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Shut up, liver.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, my liver hurts.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'd like a beer, please.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, but I am a pilot.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I stowed it safely in the overhead compartment.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I -,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, that's exactly why I'm here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But, I keep tellin' ya, I'm not a pilot.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, yeah, um, uh as a change of pace, I'm gonna let you do most of the work. I think you're ready for it, Alan.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And um, ah, I'll just uh get us started...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good news, everybody. Because I endangered lives, we can fly anywhere we want.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, you deserve a vacation. It's a chance for you to clean up after us in a whole other state.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on Marge, I want to shake off the dust of this one-horse town. I want to explore the world. I want to watch TV in a different time zone. I want to visit strange exotic malls. I'm sick of eating hoagies. I want a grinder, a sub, a foot-long hero. I want to live, Marge! Won't you let me live? Won't you please?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So Marge, pretty sweet, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, what's wrong? Are you Hungry? Sleepy? Gassy? Gassy? Is it gas? It's gas, isn't it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Take it easy, Marge. How 'bout if we dope you up real good?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's okay, Marge. We don't need to go on a trip. We'll just wait for the killer bees to come to us.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm sure it's nothing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Permit me to solve the mystery. Your mother has a fear of flying.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not everybody.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where? Where?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, the important thing is for your mother to repress what happened. Push it deep down inside her... so she'll never annoy us again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You heard your mother's ramblings. She's fine, so behave.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, it's three A.M. Shouldn't you be baking?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I don't believe in it. It breaks up families.... turns wives against husbands... children against fathers... neighbors against me. You don't have to pay some fancy psychiatrist ten bucks an hour to get top notch therapy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's Raining Men!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now Marge, ""Dear Abby"" says seeing films about air travel can calm your fears. Ooh, here are some upbeat titles. ""Hero."" ""Fearless."" ""Alive.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,She's fine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Every since you started therapy all you can do is talk about yourself. Well what about me, Marge?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, Lisa, you got your way. Your mom's going to a psychiatrist. She's gonna tell Marge to leave me. It'll break up the family, and you'll have to live with your grandmother and pick beans.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well keep it up, then.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good, you do that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You'll be picking many a bean.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, leave that man alone with his pain and sit down.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right. How much do you charge?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Keep sliding.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. First, what are your qualifications?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no, I'm not here to take a reading test. I wanna see some credentials.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You see?! You see?! ""I"" just left ""my"" first session and ""I"" haven't opened ""my"" mouth yet.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Did you talk about me in therapy today?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Tell me the truth! Don't tell her I raised my voice. Don't. Happy family, happy family.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, being stuck on this God forsaken planet has vanquished what little appetite I have.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why, you clattering clank of.... My dear lady, as you well know my back is a disaster area. D'oh the pain! D'oh the pain of it all!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's okay. You don't have to make her into some kind of superwoman. She can get on a plane. That's plenty.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry about a thing, honey. I'm gonna help you through this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Those are all normal noises. Luggage compartment closing. Cross-checking. Just sit back and relax.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's just the engine powering up. That's just the engine struggling.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's just a carp swimming around your ankles.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What should we do until you get back?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, it didn't work.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lousy traffic jams. The traffic report'll get me outta this one.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, how come you guys got such great parking places?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, Econo-Save, you just made the list.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, will you guys help me fix my...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, how come you guys got better chairs than me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you guys wanna go bowling tonight?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Like what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shut up.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I saved your life. That egg sandwich could have killed you by cholesterol.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So anyway, Lenny and Carl are never around on Wednesdays. And they don't tell me where they go. It's like a conspiracy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I do... now. Anyway, I'm gonna follow them tonight and see where they go.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, something did.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, okay. Have it your own way, Marge. I'll be back in a minute. I'm going outside. To stalk... ... Lenny and Carl.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,All I have to do is follow the yellow drip road.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hee hee hee! I can see everything. And they're none the wiser, hee hee hee.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I saw weird stuff in that place last night. Weird strange sick twisted eerie godless evil stuff. And I want in.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stonecutters, eh? How do I join?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Next.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, one of those egg-counsel creeps got to you too, huh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You'd better run, egg!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why don't people like me, Marge?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then why don't those stupid idiots let me in their crappy club for jerks?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It is. It's been happening to me all my life.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I felt so left out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'd give anything to get into the Stonecutters.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What do they do? What don't they do! Oh they do so many things... they never stop... oh the things they do there! My stars.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not as such, no.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Do I ever! It's five years later and I still think I'm a chicken. I'm a chicken, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is it. My ticket in. They have to let me join if I'm the son of a member.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll take this Communist one too.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Comin' through! Can't throw me out! My father's a member! I'm in, I'm in!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, thanks, Lenny. When am I gonna be initiated?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Number one? Ha ha. What kind of stupid wiener name is that? ""Hello, my name is Number One."" And so forth.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You outrank Mr. Burns here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is he the leader?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay, I didn't ask for your life story.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think I have to do it again. My blindfold came off.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, have you ever noticed that the ""Crossing the Desert"" is a lot like ""The Unblinking Eye"" and it's exactly like ""The Wreck of the Hesperus""?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And by the Sacred Parchment I swear that if I reveal the secrets of the Stonecutters may my stomach become bloated and my head be plucked of all but three hairs.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh really?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But what if I were to shake your hand in this wise?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Heh heh heh! So long, suckers!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yep, but they gave me these Rollerblades so I can glide to the front door.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Heh heh heh heh. Sweet.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Jealous?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're jealous.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's this?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Everything lasts forever.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's because you trust your stupid school books. Here's what really happened at the signing of the Declaration of Independence...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You wanna see how Davy Crockett really died at the Alamo? You must be 18.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah. Beer busts, beer blasts, keggers, stein hoists, AA meetings, beer night. It's wonderful, Marge. I've never felt so accepted in all my life. These people looked deep within my soul, and assigned me a number based on the order in which I joined.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,WHO RIGS EVERY OSCAR NIGHT? /,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh-oh. I need a bib. If I slop any on my shirt, I could lose the respect of my beloved brethren.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The Black Panthers?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Huh? Oh. Yeah. Thanks, Lenny.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What? Did I miss something?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Please don't kick me out! This society is everything to me! Please give me another chance! I've learned my lesson.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've learned my lesson!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh. Sorry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh that. It's just a birth mark and I'll thank you not to stare.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo-hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow. Mental note. Don't overdo this.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Peek-a-boo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I always wondered if there was a god. And now I know. There is. And it's me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Remove the girl.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh I win again, don't I? Woo hoo.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, I think you guys are lettin' me win.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"From now on, I want you to be honest with me. I mean, I'm not perfect, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, you were right. My happiness is fading.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What do you mean, isolated? ...ated...ated..ated..ated.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hm... I could help others. I'll get a bunch of monkeys, dress them up, and make them reenact the Civil War .",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Couldn't hurt -- unless the monkeys start hurting people... which they almost certainly would.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Brothers, brothers.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Brothers, I've learned a wonderful lesson. Helping others makes our own lives better and makes us better people. So instead of just shooting pool and drinking beer, let us Stonecutters use what we have to help the less fortunate.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You were right, Lisa. I've never felt so spiritually fulfilled. And with my brothers, the Stonecutters, behind me, this is the beginning of a better world for all of us.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, fellas. Can I join?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Loyal stonecutters, let us begin our reenactment of the Battle of Gettysburg.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Marge, kids, I miss my club.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, Marge you're right. The Simpson family is the best possible club I could belong to.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This club'd better be worth it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Go Knightboat, go!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Quiet. I will not hear another word against the Boat.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, Knightboat. The crime solving boat.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It was Bart.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So many memories. Aw, look... Knightboat.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thanks honey. Bank shot.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And here's our TV next to the mirror. It looks like we have two.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Moom.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's exciting.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm glad you asked. It's actually a very interesting story.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It all began about two years ago, before Maggie was even born. Bart, you were Lisa's age and Lisa you were the age Bart was several years ago.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Listen carefully and my words will shape images as clear as any TV show. It was a tumultuous time for our nation. The clear beverage craze gave us all a reason to live.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The Information Super-highway showed the average person what some nerd thinks about ""Star Trek,"" and the domestication of the dog continued unabated.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I was at my work station when suddenly...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not on my shift.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh no you don't!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Simpson ten, terrorists eight.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Woo hoo! This is it! With this single glorious check, I'm finally completely out of debt.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes! With my bills paid off, I can finally quit this lousy job.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't worry about Homer J. I've got a plan. A plan that'll fix you good.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, that just slipped out. I'll miss ya.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Did you hear me? I said, I quit, Monty. And since I quit, I can do anything I want.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, lovely desk. It would be too bad if someone, oh, I don't know... didn't use a coaster!!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Such a nice tidy office. Maybe it's time you started living like a pig!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I hope I haven't upset you... bongo head!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's for employing me for eight years! Ha ha.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And that is that. Goodbye mind-numbing, back-breaking labor forever. Hello dream job in paradise.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And now the final phase of my plan.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Barney, any chance you can get me a job here?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, Marge. I've come up with a perfectly balanced budget. There will be exactly enough money for you, me, Bart and Lisa, if we make a few small sacrifices.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"From now on we use regular toilet paper, not that fancy quilted kind...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And only one of you kids can go to college.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That night your mother and I went out for a romantic evening to celebrate the start of our new life. We began with dinner and dancing... followed by a stroll on the beach...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've got sand in my underpants.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I love you, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Everything in our lives is finally perfectly balanced. I hope things stay exactly like this forever.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's okay, Marge. They pave the way for this kind of filth in school.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Actually, your mother hadn't told me yet. At that time, I had no idea Maggie even existed.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hi Maggie.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So anyhoo, back then there was no way for me to know your mother was pregnant.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you tie up the bathroom every morning. I've got to wash my hair.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The next few weeks at my dream job were like a wonderful waking coma.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmm... bowling fresh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmm... urinal fresh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...I slowly learned the intricate mysteries of the alley, like where the pins go after they're knocked down.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I was in heaven. If horse racing is the sport of kings, then surely bowling... is a very good sport as well.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'M GONNA MAKE IT AFTER ALL!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Can't talk, praying. Dear Lord, the gods have been good to me and I am thankful. For the first time in my life, everything is absolutely perfect just the way it is.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, wait a minute. What are all these presents? It looks like you're ""showering"" Marge with gifts.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, it was my major.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So here's the deal: you freeze everything as it is, and I won't ask for anything more. If that is okay, please give me absolutely no sign. Okay, deal. In gratitude, I present you this offering of cookies and milk. If you want me to eat them for you, give me no sign. Thy will be done.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ah... another perfect day in my perfect life with my perfect job.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thank you. Thank you very much. It is nice work.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's true, the bundle is little. But I'm not in it for the money.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This is getting very abstract, but thank you. I do enjoy working at the bowling alley.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Man. It's windy as hell out there.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmmm. With little, tiny, baby-sized gifts. Well... I'll be in the tub.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,New job?... Marge is pregnant?! Nooooo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh just that one time.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're pregnant?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're pregnant again?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well who wouldn't be upset? That new baby in your mother's womb was a ticking time bomb threatening to blow this family eight ways from Sunday! Hey, where're you going?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're pregnant! We're gonna have to have a baby! All our financial plans are ruined. We're doomed! Doomed I tells ya!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Anyhoo...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We're doomed!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Check.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, a raise! I've never been good enough at any job to deserve one before. But I'm damn good at this one. That's it! I'm gonna march right up to Al and say...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Steve -- I mean Al, I think I deserve a raise.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How about if I triple the business? Then could I get a raise?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Of course!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bowling! Bowling here! Come bowl now! Get yer bowling! Who's ready?! Bowling!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"My marketing plan attracted a record number of police and fire officials, but few stayed to bowl. I failed. Quitting my dream job was the hardest thing I've ever done.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This was the happiest time of my life. I'll never forget you guys. Especially you, Joey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, Joey. We'll make it to California some day.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I needed more money to support my growing family. And there was only one place in town that a man like me could make it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Actually, I quit and I came to get my job back.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Seems like the classy thing to do would be not to call attention to it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thanks for giving me my old job back.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've never been so miserable in all my life. But I can't take it out on Marge and the kids. I've got to carry the burden all by myself.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hi honey, how are you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't go on with this charade any longer. I hate my job. I hate my life. And ever since I found out about this baby there's been nothing but bad luck.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's just in one ear and out the other with you isn't it, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's wonderful! It's magical! Oh boy, here it comes - another mouth.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marvelous.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hello. Aw. It's a boy... And what a boy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A girl! Oh Marge, we have a wonderful baby girl! Not just a girl, the most beautiful baby girl in the whole world!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on Marge, show a little enthusiasm.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Absolutely.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, there are pictures. I keep them where I need the most cheering up.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,...And then I sped away without anyone seeing my license plate.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, except I forgot to go to work.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Will you all stop worrying about that stupid comet? It's going to be destroyed. Didn't you hear what the guy in the building said?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, the whole reason we have elected officials is so we don't have to think all the time. Just like that rain forest scare a few years back. Our officials saw there was a problem, and they fixed it. Didn't they?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,There's that word again.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well then, I have a back-up plan. See, while the unprepared are still sitting around twiddling their thumbs and going doo-doo-doo-dee-doo-do-doo...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm getting to that. So anyway, they're going, doo-dee-doo-do-doo...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So anyway we get in our car and take the bridge out of town, while all the while they're still going, doo-dee-doo-do-doo...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's at times like this I wish I were a religious man.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just a second.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What's everyone so worked up about? So there's a comet. Big deal. It'll burn up in our atmosphere, and whatsever left will be no bigger than a chihuahua's head.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Of course I'm right. If I'm not, may we all be horribly crushed from above somehow.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, if you're that worried about it, let's go down to the bomb shelter.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Homer Simpson takes care of his family.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Flanders! Open up!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get out of there. My family needs to use your bomb shelter.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No deal. Out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,An hour! I can't wait another hour. What's keeping that stupid comet?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,THERE it is.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't get the... I can't get the door closed. Somebody's going to have to get out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, yeah. I can do that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute. We all know the one thing we won't need in the future: left handed stores. That's you, Flanders.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm terribly sorry. Flanders is the only useless person here. If anyone dies, it should be him. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. So let's kick Flanders out. Sorry.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no! Shut up! Shut up! Stop it, stop it! I can't take this anymore. I can't let that brave man out there die alone. I'm surprised and disgusted by all of you. Especially his children. I'm goin' out there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And it was a baby ox.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know kids, I'm scared too.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I am holding still. I am squirming.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It must be the first of the month! New billboard day!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""This year give her English Muffins."" Whatever you say, Mr. Billboard.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Best in the West. It rhymes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Clown college? You can't eat that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I got everything I was supposed to get. I'm not going to enroll in that clown college though. That advertisement had no effect on me whatsoever.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Clowns are funny.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's it! You people have stood in my way long enough. I'm going to clown college!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hurry up -- it's my first day of clown college.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You weren't complaining when I got you this close to Chachi.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Homer.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, I've never had a pair of pants that fit this well in my life.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stop it! You're killing me! Seattle...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Steady, steady...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Kill wealthy dowager.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Got it! No shock for me .,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lord save me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Omigod! He's stealing all the burgers! Why you little - I've got you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, hey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And - then - take - that, and - put - that - in - there - and Ah. Here's your giraffe, little girl.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's the spirit. Never give up.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm beat, and after work I've got to dedicate a new jiffy lube and co-host the Ace Awards.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah. When I started this clown thing I thought it would be nothing but glory. You know, the glory of being a clown? I tell ya, it's hard, tiring work, but when I see the smiles on their little faces, I just know they're getting ready to jab me with something.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And now the winner for the most promising new series on cable: old ""Starsky and Hutches.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, can't. I've got to go distract bulls at a rodeo.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh... no. I'm going a different way than you, Dick.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, you're gonna be having dinner with Groucho tonight if you don't beat it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Being a clown sucks. You get kicked by kids, bit by dogs, and admired by the elderly. Who am I clowning? I have no business being a clown. I'm leaving the clowning business to all the other clowns in the clowning business.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh no.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm not Krusty.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I am not Krusty.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, he didn't give me a ticket! This is an intriguing development.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You mean I get 5% off on everything in the store just because I look like... I mean, just because I am Krusty the clown?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm telling you, Marge, this will work. They'll think I'm Krusty and give us free stuff. I've been gettin' free stuff all day. Look at this swell bucket of house paint.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look at it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well if we agree, then why are we arguing?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I want a free car because I'm Krusty. Krusty the clown! Get it? Krus-ty!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I want everything that's coming to Krusty the clown, which is me... Krusty.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what are these holes?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah. Speed holes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Putting speed holes in my car. Makes it go faster.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What keeps doin' that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But wait. You can't kill me for being Krusty. I'm not him. I'm Homer Simpson.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... actually my name is Barney. Yeah. Barney Gumbel.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh... actually my real name is uh... Think, Krusty, think... Joe Valachi.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Benedict Arnold!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Krusty the clown.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But, I've never been able to do the...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How 'bout if I just squirt you in the face with my boutonniere?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll never be able to do this trick... never.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey! I'm doing it! I'm doing it! I'm the greatest clown in the world!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Krusty! Oh thanks! Thanks a lot! You came here to save me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Heh-heh, good one, Krusty.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ta-Da!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm a singing in the show... Hot! Yeow! Cold! Ow! Hot! Cold! Hot! Ow! Who's! Doing! That?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Burkina Faso? Disputed Zone? Who called all these weird places?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I'm gonna ask Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Psh, that's no reason to block the TV.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There it is. ""Aust-rali-a."" I'll be damned...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look at this country: ""U - r - gay.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, he'll agitate ya. Ho, ho. He sure will. What can we do for you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's tough but fair. Boy, go with the man.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All Bart has to do is apologize, and we get a free trip to Australia?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We left at 1:30 P.M. Monday. What time is it now?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, are you like one of those English guards who can't laugh or smile or anything?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah, this is the life. Boy, next summer, can you commit some fraud in Orlando, Florida?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,SWEET LAND OF LIBERTY... OF THEE I SING.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Really? Look, boy! Now I'm in Australia! Now I'm in America!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Australia! America! Austr--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"--alia! America, Australia, Ameri-- ow!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, gimme one of those famous giant beers I've heard so much about.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No. It's pretty big, I guess.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Punishment?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Booting?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What kind of a sick country would kick someone with a giant boot?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You sold us out, Conover!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stay back or I'll boot your Prime Minister! I'll do it! So help me God I'll boot him!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"When will you Australians learn? In America, we've stopped using corporal punishment, and things have never been better. The streets are safe. Old people strut confidently through the darkest alleys. And the weak and nerdy are admired for their computer programming abilities. So, like us, let your children run wild and free. Because, as the old saying goes, let your children run wild and free. Now boy, run back to the embassy! Back to American soil!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, there's a lot more mucus!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maaarge!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Show 'em what American butts are made of, son!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, do we get to land on an aircraft carrier?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, look. Those frogs are eating all their crops.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Take a guess.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, that's right Barney. This year I invested in pumpkins. They've been going up the whole month of October, and I got a feeling they're gonna peak right around January. And bang, that's when I'll cash in.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, let's not panic. I'll make the money back by selling one of my livers. I can get by with one.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How am I going to tell Marge we're broke? I need a miracle.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My house is on fire! Woo hoo! Insurance to the rescue.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, we had a deal. Your sisters don't come here after six, and I stop eating your lipstick.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, that's the last straw. It's time to take out the trash. But first, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wrong!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sweet, trusting Marge. I can't let you down. I'll get some money somehow.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,If only I could think of an invention. Something that would really make money. Must concentrate and work harder than I've ever worked...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, could I just get a look at that?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But uh, could I just...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let me see! Let me see! Out of the way!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, my invention! All my money problems could've...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge, my loyal wife, of course not.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And Lisa, my little princess.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And who could forget dear Rat boy?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Gosh, Moe, I use these all the time. Couldn't you just bash my head in?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Rye am Romer Rimpson...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, I need an another extension on my mortgage payments.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That was in the third grade.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, good luck finding it because I'm gonna take the numbers off tonight.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then I'll take off the numbers on my neighbor's house.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, you'll get your money.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're my last-last chance, bottom of the barrel, Hail Mary, long shot, wish you would do it but probably won't, final resort, to lend me money.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What a wonderful dinner. What a beautiful family. Someone get a picture of me with my arm around this steak.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, Lisa, I managed to solve a little problem today. And to celebrate, I'm going to tilt my chair.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mmmm, slanty.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Time to fertilize the lawn. A couple five-hundred-pound bags should do it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It means these two fabulous babes are staying for dinner.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, you had your fun. Now get lost.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hunh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No! I'm giving them a foot massage. At least let me have that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, maybe I'll just stay and work overtime. My sisters-in-law are at my house again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Request permission to slink by.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But you're already smoking cig...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're really pushing it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll have to trust you on that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No! Don't tell Marge! I'll be good. I'll be good!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But... Yes, ma'am.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Rabsolutely rothing, Rarge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What paper?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't know Marge, I can't be expected to keep track of all my wheelings and dealings.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You told!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry Marge.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I never want to see you again! You either!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I was ashamed, Marge. I failed you as a husband and a provider, and at best, I was a B-plus dog. I'll understand if you want to sleep on the couch tonight.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nobody make me any breakfast. A man so deeply in debt doesn't deserve it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"In that case, I'll just have french toast with double butter and a side of bacon. But no powdered sugar, I don't deserve it. Maybe a little powdered sugar.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What was that -- national anthem?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Daddy has very important work to do. He's looking through the Want Ads to find a part-time job.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no wonder I didn't hear about Bart being elected world's greatest sex machine.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll never pay off that debt.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's it! I'll make money with a chauffeur job. Good thing you turned on that TV, Lisa.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No. Well anyway, turn it off.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh wow! I can't believe my very first passenger is comedy legend, Mel Brooks! I love that movie, ""Young Frankenstein"". ...Scared the Hell out of me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, let's do that two thousand pound man thing. I'll be that Carl Reiner guy, you be what's his face.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sir, today every country has a national anthem. Did they have national anthems two thousand years ago?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Chauffeur's license, eh? Mel, buckle your borscht belt!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stupid driving test at the stupid DMV where stupid Patty and stupid Selma work. Sometimes I think God is teasing me, just like he teased Moses in the desert.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, okay Marge, I'll get along with them. Then I will hug some snakes! Yes, I will hug and kiss some poisonous snakes. Now that's sarcasm.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, all I ask is that you be fair.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You won't be happy 'til my family thinks I'm a loser, will you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nagging the driver, minus ten points for you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Being a jerk, minus a million points.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll never forgive myself for this.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes. I am in flavor country.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's a big country.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Please, on top of everything else, don't make me picture your hides.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I didn't do it for them. I did it for you, Marge. I'd kill for you. Please ask me to kill for you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Call off the debt?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Call off the debt?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Debt's off! Let's go, Marge. Woo hoo!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, are we Jewish?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmmmm.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But what can I do? I'm just... one man.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Relaxed fit, my Aunt Fanny! Stupid Dockers! Oh, the belt is buckled.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My ears are burning.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, my ears are really burning. I wanted to see inside, so I lit a Q-tip.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, is this a pimple or a boil?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you're right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,There ya... Just second...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that should...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It was a gummy bear.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart Simpson, meet Jay Sherman, the Critic.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But, I'm still hungry.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, well I won the belching contest at work.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, well Scooby Doo can doo-doo... but Jimmy Carter is smarter!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whatcha doing, Marge?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, do you respect my intelligence?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay! Wait a minute. Why did it take you so long to say yes?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay! Wait a minute. Are you humoring me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay! Wait a minute. That's bad! Look, I know I'm not witty like that critic guy. But does he know all the words to the Oscar Mayer song?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's it, Marge, he knows the whole hot dog song. Go ahead, sleep with him. I'll just take a lock of your hair to remember you by.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's just you and me now, lock of hair...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, well you think I'm stupid.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Prove it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Put me on that film jury festival thing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Exactly. Heh, heh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pull my finger.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This contest is over. Give that man the ten thousand dollars!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But ... The ball... His groin!... It works on so many levels! Roll it again.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What'd I miss?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Football in the groin. Football in the groin.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good idea, Marge. My mind is going a mile a minute.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I have every right to be on that jury even though I got there because I'm sleeping with the head of the festival.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh great, now you're going to make fun of me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I've got some serious thinking to do.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hm. Barney's movie has heart. But football in the groin had a football in the groin.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow. I'll never drink another beer.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll take ten.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, you know something Marge, it's not that tough being a film cricket.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, look. This has spring snakes inside, but the suckers will think it's Beer Nuts. Mmm... Beer Nuts.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can I have some?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sweet maiden of the spit, grant now my boon, that I mightst sup on suckling pig this noon.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've eaten eight different meats. I'm a true Renaissance man.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Woo hoo! Oh, Marge, that's great news!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, ah, but Mr. Milhouse, my little girl's getting married!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I gotta call everyone and tell 'em the good news.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Will that girl ever shut up? Okay, Marge. I'll plan everything. We can have the reception at Moe's. Wait, why not have the whole wedding there? We'll do it on a Monday morning -- there'll be fewer drunks.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, these seem to be in order. I'll be out back in the hammock.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yo, Hugh. Here's a little bit of U.S. hospitality. What do you think of that?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whew! Uh, enjoy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You can be the first to try out the new guest bedroom I built. Remember, if the building inspector comes by, it's not a room, it's a window box.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, Hugh. Have you heard all the latest American jokes? Uh, here's a good one. Pull my finger.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I said, pull my finger.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Me and Bart'll take Hugh out on the town this afternoon.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Great. There's only one thing I ask in return.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So this driving on the left makes you feel more at home, huh Hugh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hugh, there's something I want you to have. My Dad gave me his cuff links to wear on the day I married Marge, and they brought us good luck. I couldn't imagine a happier marriage. We don't have many traditions in our family, but it'd mean a lot to me if you kept this one alive.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, it's so great to have the whole family together under one roof. I never realized how much I missed it. Listen to the murmurs in the next room. The house is full of life again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Keep it down in there!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, how are you. Nice to meet ya.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know what's great about you English? ""Octopussy."" Man, I must have seen that movie... twice.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ooh la la.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You look great, sweetheart.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Little Lisa. Lisa Simpson. You know, I always felt you were the best thing my name ever got attached to. Since the time you learned to pin your own diapers, you've been smarter than me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no, let me finish. I just want you to know I've always been proud of you. You're my greatest accomplishment and you did it all yourself. You helped me understand my own wife better and taught me to be a better person. But you're also my daughter, and I don't think anybody could have had a better daughter than you--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,See? You're still helping me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, no...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I found them on the night stand this morning. I guess they weren't his cup of tea. Don't worry about it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, Lisa! Where were you!? You missed the most incredible thing!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I ate seven pounds of fudge!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The man at the stand said it was a record!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I rode the teacups! Then I got a little sick and I had to sit down. But then I rode 'em again!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who spread garbage all over Flanders' yard before I got a chance to?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Did they?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmm, I guess Bart's not to blame. He's lucky too, because it's spankin' season and I've got a hankerin' for some spankerin'.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"My ""Best of Ray Stevens featuring The Streak"" album! So it was the dog that buried all our stuff!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my God! He's got the precious cable TV cable!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, problem solved.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You got it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry. We'll catch him, or run him over tryin'.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry. As soon as they find out he doesn't have any money, they'll throw him out. Believe me, I know.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We can't lose. Look at the name of the dog I bet on.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're lucky you got looks, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes! Come on, you little horse!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, so that's what's been wrong with the little fella. He misses casual sex.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now it's two sets of twins.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, we've waited many years, but the good Lord has finally blessed us with a real family.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get that cat out of the way!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ooh... this time... Ah...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do you have a better idea?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"How do you explain the culottes, boy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Your mother and I have been thinking about giving the puppies away.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mainly your mother.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Splendid. Who's coming?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who wouldn't?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, I'm sorry, Mr. Burns, but you can't have these dogs. Am I fired?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A little too well, if you ask me. I'm sure he's plotting some brilliant scheme to get those puppies.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you know that batting this lightbulb is the only thing that cheers me up after giving away those million dollar greyhounds.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lousy teachers. Trying to palm off our kids on us.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, if you don't like your job you don't strike. You just go in every day and do it really half-assed. That's the American way.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, it's always in the last place you look.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I know. And this perpetual motion machine she made today is a joke. It just keeps going faster and faster.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, how was everybody's day at school?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, anyone can miss Canada... all tucked away down there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I've had just about enough of your Vassar bashing young lady.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, this is wonderful! You're alive!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really? Wow.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kids are so naÃ¯ve. Lisa, when you get to be our age, you'll learn a few things, like when a sign says ""Do Not Feed The Bears,"" man, you'd better not feed the bears.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now get to school, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man, these are primo seats. I could really go for a hot dog.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, honey, are you gonna be okay?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh I'm sure he knew. And I'm sure that wherever he is now, he's happy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, it's like the time that your cat, Snowball, got run over.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Remember, honey?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What I'm saying is, all we have to do is go down to the pound and get a new jazzman.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I blew it again.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmmmmm.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, honey, if you really want to preserve his memory, I recommend getting a tattoo. It preserves the things you love.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Starland Vocal Band?! They suck!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I won't rest until I've gotten a hot dog.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Jazz. They just make it up as they go along. I could do that. Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"OK, then this. Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo... doo doo doo doo doo doo",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,They're butchering the classics. Could that bassoon have come in any more late?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Laser effects, mirrored balls. John Williams must be rolling around in his grave.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We're outta here!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whoa, careful now. These are dangerous streets for us upper-lower-middle-class types... So avoid eye contact, watch your pocketbook and suspect everyone.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Easy money!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then how come that guy's winning?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Twenty on this one, my good man.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No Marge!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, it is exhilarating to see the police get their man and save a hysterical woman.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Easy now, sweetheart. Homie's here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You did what?!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nothing. I'm just a little edgy since your mother told me she wants to be a cop.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you being a cop makes you the man, which makes me the woman. And I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which, as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, thanks, honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I want you to take care of yourself out there. You've become very dear to me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Marge, one squirt and you're south of the border.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmm. Incapacitating.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Shush, dear, you'll wreck Daddy's fun.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,". Fooled you Flanders. Made you think your family was dead. Didja get it? They're not, though.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But you thought they were.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""The Girls of the Internet."" Ooh, I'd go on line with them any day.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, hurry it up with the cards, Lenny. I've got you clocked at two miles per hour.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All the more reason to hurry up. Hey, what could be going a hundred miles per --",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you chased away all my poker buddies.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you've become such a cop! And, not that long ago, you were so much more to me - you were a cleaner of pots, a sewer of buttons, an unplugger of hairy clogs.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're cooking what for dinner?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Marge. How's my little piglet?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's okay. I'm supposed to be workin', too.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll just be a second, Marge. I'm going to get some beer for those kids over there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll be right back. Now keep your eyes peeled for a real cop.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, we're family.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll make you a deal. You rip up that ticket, and I'll give you back your hat. Wuh, wuh, wuh! Hee, hee-hee!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What're you gonna do about it? What're you gonna do? Ooh, I'm Officer Marge, I'm gonna arrest you! Whoa! etc.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whuh! Marge, not here. Hey, you're not really arresting me...?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I choose to waive that right.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lemme just finish this last lobster tail and raspberry torte.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I have nothing more to say to you, Marge. I'm drawing a line down the center of the house Ã  la ""I Love Lucy"" -- you stay on your side and I'll stay on my side.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, when Marge first told me she was going to the Police Academy, I thought it'd be fun and exciting, you know, like that movie, ""Spaceballs."" But instead, it's been painful and disturbing, like that movie ""Police Academy.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right guys, pipe down. I've got some more in the garage.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmm... I wonder why he's so eager to go to the garage.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, what do you call it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Herman, I had to come out here to see what's so funny - A counterfeit jeans ring operating out of my car hole! I'm gonna tell everyone! Wait here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Herman, how could you? We've all thought about counterfeiting jeans at one time or another, but what about the victims? Hard working designers, like Calvin Klein, Gloria Vanderbilt, or Antoine Bugle Boy. These are the people who saw an over-crowded marketplace and said, ""me too.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Herman, your beef is with me. Leave the girl out of this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's too late for me, Marge! Sell the jeans and live like a queen.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge. You saved my life! I'm sorry I teased you. You're a really good cop. I'm proud of you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"He's gettin' away! You blew it, Marge!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, how did you know...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, what I was wondering is...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes there is, there's a garage full of counterfeit jeans.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What for? Nobody cared when Bogart defaced that sidewalk in Hollywood.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, Bart's a tutor now. Tute on, Son! Tute on!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, Marge, you can't blame all of Bart's problems on your one little speech. If anything turned him bad, it's that time you let him wear a bathing suit instead of underwear. And let's not forget your little speech...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, there is. Come on, everybody, let's go into Shelbyville and get those kids back ourselves! I got an R.V. we can use... Flanders's!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Pile in, everybody! No time to wipe your feet!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Found 'em!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You kids are in big trouble, running away from home like this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't care what excuse you've got, nothing's gonna stop me in the middle of this speech, you're gonna -- lemon tree?!!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That tree's been in Springfield since the time of our forefathers. Give it back or we'll bust in there and take it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupider like a fox!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This is the darkest day in the history of Springfield. If anybody wants me, I'll be in the shower.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, great. Now I'm upside-down.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No one in history has ever done anything this clever.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's okay, son. I'll take care of him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Faster, son -- he's got a taste for meat now!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo-hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here's your package, Mr. Burns!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,--son!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I hate my job. I mean, what's the point when your boss doesn't even remember your name?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What? What's your idea?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's all well and good, but it's not really your idea, is it now Marge?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, he's not all bad. He did send me this nice thank-you card.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kids, would you step outside for a second?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,F-F-F-F-F-F-,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stop it, stop it, stop it! Stop it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Homer Simpson! Homer Simpson! Shut up! Homer Simpson! My name is Homer Simpson!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you're a dead man! Oh, you're dead! You're dead Burns!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,He can't remember my name!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Berserk is right!! May I have some iced tea, please?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kids! Kids! Kids! As far as Daddy's concerned, you're both potential murderers.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My tool shed! Oh Dad!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sure! I've had it up to here with these damn rickets!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I had a damn good reason. He could never remember my name...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Homer Simpson! Homer Simpson!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Me! Me! Me, me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I swear, I've never seen that gun before.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, right. You chose fruit, you live with fruit.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No. No. No. Ewww. Why is this on the floor?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So you finally learned my name, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've got no time for your demented parlor games! You won't be telling anyone else that Homer Simpson shot you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stop telling them it was me. I'll kill you for saying it was me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Say it Burns. Say I never shot you... Before.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah. And who the hell are you talkin' to? Marge, do you have other men in this house? Radioactive men?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Which one were you? The ugly one?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Were you the ugly one?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Guess what, kids. They're gonna pay us fifty dollars a day to film some of the movie here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Careful now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, didn't you direct ""Unnatural Discretion""?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hooey! Whew, oh. You know, I never walk out of a movie, but Eech!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You guys work on the movie?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I always wanted to be a teamster. So lazy and surly. Mind if I relax next to you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, there's a spider near my car keys.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ahhh, that's better. Now that we're alone, Papa Bear has a li'l honey for his Mama Bear.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, never you mind...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What advantages does this motorcar have over, say, a train? Which I could also afford.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No we shan't. Yoink!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, we'll clean up this afternoon.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I got my dad to look after her.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, Honey, you work yourself stupid for this family. If anyone deserves to be wrapped up in seaweed and buried in mud, it's you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah. If that mafia guy weren't staring at us, I'd take off my towel.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I love gettin' away from this dump.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We leave you the kids for three hours and the county takes them away?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Saxa-ma-phone. Saxa-ma-phone.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge, don't blame yourself. I'm the terrible parent. The boy bugs the hell outta me, I can't help Lisa with her homework. The only thing I'm fit to take care of is a houseplant.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lousy houseplant!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now wait a minute! Okay, I'm not gonna win Father of the Year. In fact, I'm probably the last guy in the world who should have kids. Wait, can I start again? Fathering children is the best part of my day... I'd do anything for Bart and Lisa!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Who? Lady, you got the wrong file.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Maggie. I got nothing against Maggie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Communication. Gotcha.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen. Yes, I know.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I have listening skills!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Shut up, Judge!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Garbage in garbage can. Makes sense.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What I wouldn't give to hear Lisa play another one of her jazzy tunes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I wish I knew something about the baby I could miss now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Todd Smells. Aw, I already knew that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you cotton pickin' --,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No! I've gotta pass this class for my kids. Son, let's stop the fussin' and a-feudin'.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I love you, Cletus!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kids, we're good parents now! Get your asses out here!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh no! In the eyes of God they'll be Flanderseseseses!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay, don't panic. To find Flanders, I just have to think like Flanders!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The Springfield River!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Son of a bitch...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Noooooooo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Bartholemew, I feel like St. Augustine of Hippo after his conversion by Ambrose of Milan.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I said shut your ugly face, Flanders.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, there's my sweet little Maggie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah! Gimme all the dirt!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Old painty-can Ned!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Marge, remember when we used to make out to this hymn?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm not ashamed.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How about Chairman Moe's Magic Wok?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I got it! Madman Moe's Pressure Cooker!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Forty seconds? But I want it now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ow! Help me. Why isn't anybody, ow, helping me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hi, is Milhouse home?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmm. Sounds good.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, that's Moe! The guy from the ad!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And he knows my name.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, you didn't finish your Spaghetti and Moe-Balls!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Run, boy! Run!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Run for your life!... ... Boy!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why? That was the problem in the first place. You were going broke because we were your only customers. Wasn't that the problem in the first place? That you were going broke... Moe?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe? Hey, Moe? Oh, you're thinking about all the money you blew, aren'tcha?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What was it? 50-60 thousand dollars? ... Moe? Look, maybe it would help if you went over all the mistakes you made from the beginning... Moe?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let me get a pad....,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's the plan.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Quiet, boy. I have a feeling some bad stuff is about to go down.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It was good, but not great.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, eat the can. Come on.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Out of the way, you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Aww.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey Flanders!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shut up.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, Ned, you're having a family reunion and you didn't invite me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't believe you didn't invite me after I painted those cool stripes all over your car. I know! I'll throw my own barbecue - the greatest barbecue this town has ever seen! And I'll only invite who I want. That'll show ya.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sure.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This barbecue will be hard, thankless work, but I'm sure you're up to it, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know what you should serve, Marge? More of these lamb chops. These are the best ever.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, get a hold of yourself. This is LAMB... not A lamb.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Lisa, honey -- are you saying you're never going to eat any animal again? What about bacon?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ham?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pork chops?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, right, Lisa. A wonderful, MAGICAL animal.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, kids! I just got my party invitations back from the printer's.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's a typo.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But all normal people love meat. If I went to a barbecue and there was no meat, I would say, ""Yo, Goober! Where's the meat?"" I'm trying to impress people here, Lisa. You don't win friends with salad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, Barney! You brought a whole beer keg.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I've got the prescription for you, doctor: another hot beef injection.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,One whopper for the copper.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Here ya go!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, everybody. It's the moment you've all been waiting for! The pig de rÃ©sistance!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thanks Flanders. I have to agree that everything certainly... huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's just a little dirty -- It's still good! It's still good!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's just a little slimy! It's still good! It's still good!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's just a little airborne! It's still good! It's still good!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I know.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, you ruined my barbecue. I demand you apologize this second!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's it! Go to your room!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, since I'm not talking to Lisa, would you please ask her to pass me the syrup?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, tell Bart I just want to drink a nice glass of syrup like I do every morning.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, thank your mother for pointing that out.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, tell your mother to get off my case.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, go to your room!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't need any serving suggestions from you, you barbecue-wrecking know-nothing know-it-all.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's it. Go to your room.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lisa! Lisa!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa! Lisa, come back before everyone finds out what a horrible father I am!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I dunno. Were you looking for me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Lisa, I was looking for you. I wanted to apologize. I don't know exactly what went wrong, but I know it's always my fault.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Rock stars. Is there anything they don't know?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I understand, honey. I used to believe in things when I was a kid.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, I'll give you a piggy-back ride, oops, I mean a veggie-back ride home.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, the Miracle Mile -- where value wears a neon sombrero and there's not a single church or library to offend the eye. It truly is a miracle.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There it is! The chain that put the ""fat"" in ""fat Southern sheriffs!""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I want a colossal donut. Just like the one on the sign.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nuts!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's false advertising! Lard Lad lied!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I paid for a colossal donut, and I'm gonna get a colossal donut.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Eggheads. What do they know?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hee hee hee. I've got your donut, Lard Lad! And what are you gonna do about it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well... I acquired it legally, you can be sure of that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hello? Yes? Oh! Uh... if you're looking for that big donut of yours... uh... Flanders has it. Just smash open his house.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He came to life. Good for him.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I told you: Flanders has it. Or Moe! Go kill Moe.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well... okay. If it'll end horror.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't you ever get tired of being wrong all the time?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmmm.... sprinkles.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We'll be right back.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart?! Is that you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Take out the garbage.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lousy Smarch weather.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do not touch Willie. Good advice.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no. Better ride this one out in the closet.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah? Well it's my house, so it's my spot.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Did not.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You are?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,They got me with their legal mumbo-jumbo.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh? I never looked behind this whatchamacallit case before.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's weird. It's like something out of that twilighty show about that zone.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll take my chances in the mystery wall.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hello? Can anybody hear me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm somewhere where I don't know where I am.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just a second... No, it's a place I've never been before.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't want to alarm you, Marge...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I seem to be trapped in here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's going on here? I'm so bulgy...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My stomach sticks way out in front and my...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, shut up!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmm... Unprocessed fish sticks.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man, this place looks expensive. I feel like I'm wasting a fortune just standing here. Better make the most of it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ow! Watch it, coney.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oops.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um, it's like, ahm... did anyone see the movie ""Tron""?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Help me! Are you helping me, or are you going on and on?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, there's so much I don't know about astrophysics. I wish I'd read that book by that wheelchair guy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Help! I don't have much time!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm gonna be sucked into the black hole!... I'm gonna be sucked into oblivion!... I'm gonna be nothing and what's gonna become of me on the other side?! I don't know...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Piece of cake, son!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Craaaaaaaaaap!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Eww. This is the worst place yet.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Omigod...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, erotic cakes!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Someone's in here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nooo! Nooo! Nooo! Nooo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah! Especially your big fat... Oh, wait.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,TWO!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Arrgh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, where's Charlie? How'd he get out of this?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stupidity, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Must hurt self. Must hurt self. Must hurt self.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmm, probably better that didn't hit me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hello.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um, could you give me a little push in the opposite direction?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thank you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Carpal Tunnel Syndrome? No. Lumber Lung? No. Juggler's Despair? No. Achy-Breaky Pelvis? No. Oh, I'm never gonna be disabled. I'm sick of being so healthy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, wait... ""Hyper-Obesity."" ""If you weigh more than 300 pounds, you qualify as disabled.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes I can.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yuh-huh, that's the deal. No more exercise program! No more traffic! No more blood drives or charity walks!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm not saying it isn't sleazy, honey. But try to see it my way. All my life I've been an obese man trapped inside a fat man's body.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No. It would only worry her. If you want to add to her worries, go ahead. I guess I'm just a little more grateful for all she's done for us.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, sweetheart?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah? Well, we'll just see about that, Little Miss Smart Guy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can you recommend a doctor who will?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Of course.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What can I do to speed the whole thing up, Doctor?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it's a dream come true, boy! I can, nay, I must, eat everything I've always wanted. Now c'mon! Every second I'm out of bed, I'm burning precious calories. Now get grabbin'!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know... fish sandwich? Are you sure?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, two-twenty-five?! That means I lost weight!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Four more pounds and my dream comes true: Working at home...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Any time I want.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Flanders, bad day at the rat races?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I was going to surprise you, but what the heck -- Honey, I'm purposely gaining sixty-one pounds to get on disability.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So that's it, isn't it, Marge? Looks. I didn't know you were so shallow.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Beautiful. G'night.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've got fifteen minutes to gain a pound or I gotta face another day at work.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I need a miracle.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, honey, that looks just like a real donut...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, that's a plus.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo hoo hoo! I did it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oops, no time for that now -- the computer's starting.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thank you for your pity.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm looking for something loose and billowy. Something comfortable for my first day of work.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I use a computer!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't want to look like a weirdo. I'll just go with a muu-muu.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I pity those poor suckers on the freeway. Gas-brake-honk. Gas-brake-honk. Honk-honk-punch. Gas-gas-gas.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Eight fifty-eight. First time I've ever been early for work. Except for all those daylight savings days. Lousy farmers.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""To start, press any key."" Where's the ""any"" key?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I see essc, ctarl, and pig-up. There doesn't seem to be any ""any"" key. All this computer hacking is making me thirsty. I think I'll order a Tab.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Check core temperature? Yes-slash-No. Yes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Core temperature normal. Not too shabby. ""Vent radioactive gas?"" N-O.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Venting prevents explo-si-on. This is hard. Where's my Tab? Okay then -- yes. Vent the stupid gas.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart and Lisa have to go to school while I get to stay home. Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, why don't you live in it then?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, honey?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You dragged me all the way from work for that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Pro: I, uh... don't have to go to work.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pro: Uhh... uhh... I love you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, this is everything I've ever dreamed of, right here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And nobody's gonna take it away from me! You never had faith in me before. But let me tell you, the slim, lazy Homer you knew is dead. Now I'm a big fat dynamo. And where's that cake?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Vent radioactive gas?... Y-E-S.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,Here lies... Walt Whitman?!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Damn you, Walt Whitman! I... hate... you... Walt... freakin'... Whitman! ""Leaves of Grass"" my ass! Wait a minute. Maybe it's that other grave. The one that says ""Simpson.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why does my death keep comin' back to haunt me?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I hate to rain on your parade, lady, but this is my grave. Hey, wait a minute... Mom?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I thought you were dead.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Some people say I look like Dan Aykroyd. I can't believe you're here. Dad always told me you died while I was at the movies.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah. Well, where have you been all this time?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mom, there's something you should know about me. I almost always spoil the moment.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"First, it wasn't 25 years. It was 27 years. And second, she had a very good reason.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I 'unno. I guess I was just a horrible son and no mother would want me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then why did she leave me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I thought I dreamed that kiss.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute. There's one thing I don't understand. In all those years, why didn't you ever try to contact me?",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Good night, son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We may be the best parents in the world.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Goodnight.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,There's nothing to worry about. Now everyone go to sleep. Good night.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do I smell cookies? Where's the cookies?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Somebody ate those cookies.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think she's trying to tell us something.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Go on, Maggie. Go. Go.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wake up everybody! It's World War Three!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Quick, down to the fallout shelter! The bombs are dropping!",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Bart! Where are ya, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Aha!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There you go. Now that's not so bad, is it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hello. My name is Mr. Burns. I believe you have a letter for me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh! Look at me, I'm making people happy. I'm the Magical Man from Happyland in a gum drop house on Lollipop Lane!",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"...""No TV and No Beer Make Homer..."" something, something.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't mind if I do.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, sorry. Here's another one.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But it won't make you unhappy, right? Hey! Space Food Sticks! Oh, I wish I had these on my space adventure! Did you know I was blasted into space two years ago, Mom?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I work at the nuclear power plant.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, you'll be happy to know I don't work very hard. Actually, I'm bringing the plant down from the inside.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Ow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No it doesn't, it's funny. Their clothes are different from my clothes. Look at what they're wearin'.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, you're coming home.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Or what? You'll release the dogs? Or the bees? Or the dogs with bees in their mouths, and when they bark, they shoot bees at you? Well go ahead, do your worst.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Young man, in this house, we use a little word called ""please""...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know how you feel, Bart. When I was your age, I wanted an electric football game more than anything in the world, and my parents bought it for me, and it was the happiest day of my life. Well, goodnight.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Gotta change Maggie! Dear God, we gotta change Maggie!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmmm. We didn't have a message when we left. How very odd.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, is Lisa at Camp Granada?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"'Tis the season, Marge! We only get thirty sweet, noggy days, then the government takes it away again!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no, I'm not.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey! I don't remember saying that!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I wanna price some flip-flops and smell the new tires and consult the pharmacist for some free medical advice!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh. Somebody's got tired little legs.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmm. Wonder where the flip-flops are.... ""Menswear?""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Maybe it's ""Sporting Goods""... Wait, no, ""Sleepwear""... Oh, probably ""Better Living.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, maybe someone will give you one for Christmas...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pfft. Must have been a pretty slow century.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What are you doing to my son?!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stealing?! How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain what's-his-name? We live in a society of laws. Why do you think I took you to all those ""Police Academy"" movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Where was I? Oh yeah, stay out of my booze!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I've figured out the boy's punishment. First: he's grounded. No leaving the house, not even for school. Second: No eggnog. In fact, no nog period. And third, absolutely no stealing for three months.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh, what are you gonna do?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Check it out, boy! It's like looking into a living snow mirror!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Get 'im, Ma!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooo! ""Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions""! I'm great at these. Ask me if something smells funny in here, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't think so, stupid!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I want roast beef, you clod!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The All igh-ty ollar? I get it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ahhh... they never come around anymore now that they've got their mistresses.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, you're closing. It's getting late. My kids are probably wondering where their daddy is. There's gotta be some other place we can go. Think, Moe. Think.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm tired of being a wannabe league bowler. I wannabe a league bowler.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, we can be a team!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! We won! We won!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Excuse me, but my ""team"" is ready to bowl.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That longhair freak's bowled with us for years.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Five hundred dollars?! No problem. Would you take an out-of-state, two-party bad check?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, come on, Marge! You're getting something in return! And I'm getting a bowling team. It's win/win!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Burns never gives money to anybody. Just last week, I asked him for fifteen hundred dollars.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, I've got to get the third degree from you, too?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh... Excuse me, Mr. Burns?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Burns, I, uh, was wondering if you'd like to sponsor my bowling team... for five hundred dollars.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, everybody, if you want to ask Burns for a favor, now's the time! He's doped up or dyin' or something!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, c'mon, if we quit now we'll never know how badly they're gonna beat us.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, guys. Let's be the team that supports each other. YOU CAN DO IT OTTO / YOU CAN DO IT OTTO / HELP EACH OTHER OUT, THAT'LL BE OUR MOTTO...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"DOMO AREGATTO, MISTER ROBOTO...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lemme set the scene for you, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's a 7-10 split.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The hardest shot in bowling. It was all up to me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So I got up all my courage. Right away, my lips started to move and I came up with a chant that won the match.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't know. You know, some guy. Otto, I guess.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you're missing the point. The individual doesn't matter. It was a team effort and I was the one who came up with the whole team idea. Me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But... but...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There it is, boys, the championship trophy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, ha, ha, ha, God-boy couldn't get a strike.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, Moe, that team sure did suck last night! They just plain sucked! I've seen teams suck before, but they were the suckiest bunch of sucks that ever sucked!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gotta go. My damn wiener kids are listening.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then what are you dressed like that for?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""They made us!"" That's loser talk! You gotta start acting more like me and my team, the future league champions of the world! Nothing's gonna stop us now!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"By the way, rhyming Homer with Homer...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You want to join my what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, guys. It's not that simple, he's my boss. I'll tell you what: I'll give him a shot and if he stinks, it'll be easier to tell him no.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Welcome aboard. It wasn't any easier.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, Marge, we were so close to winning the championship. Now thanks to Burns it's never gonna happen. And I spent so much time building that trophy case.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So you're saying we're definitely gonna win? -- Woo hoo! I won't need this any more!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge! Someone broke the toilet!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Burns, as team captain, it's my duty to inform you that...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Awww.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're off the team.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thanks.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Goodbye, trophy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I guess some people never change. Or they quickly change, and then quickly change back.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Saturday afternoon TV is so boring.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm bored.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Because I'm trying to reduce my boredom.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Eh. I'll do it anyway.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, boy, we're going to see the neighbors.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Good ol' Evergreen Terrace. The swankiest street in the classiest part of Pressboard Estates.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's easier. Duh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, spray the boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, ready for the big rummage sale?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I never noticed this place!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey! What's wrong with this neighborhood? Big shot. Too good to buy a house here, Snobby?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The guy who doesn't live there.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But, Marge, it works on any Ayatollah! Ayatollah Nakhbadeh, Ayatollah Zahedi... Even as we speak, Ayatollah Razmara and his cadre of fanatics are consolidating their power!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, that's the Rhinestone Nights Fashion Gun. I need it to rhinestone-up my old clothing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh. I wanted to write ""DISCO STUD"" but I ran out of space. Not that ""Disco Stu"" didn't get his share of the action!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, hey Ned, lemme help you with that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey everybody! Who thinks Flanders should shut up?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, anyone here from... Evergreen Terrace?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think this is the best neighborhood in town. Anybody agree with me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Say. That Ayatollah thinks he's better than America. Is he right?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, for only five dollars you can sock it to him in style!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And for the man who has everything: a tie rack motor!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, big spender! / Dig this blender! / Rainbow suspenders!...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, big spender!...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Spend some dough at Table Three!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thank you, neighbors, thank you! Now let's give it up for Table Five! Ah-ah-ah-ah / Table Five, Table Five... Ah-ah-ah-ah / Table Fi-i-i-i-i-i-ve...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Table Five, Table Five...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's the big deal? It's just some new guy moving in!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why did he have to move in on my territory? Look at him. Thinks just because he led the free world he can act like a big shot.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid president. Why couldn't he just stay in his own state?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute. If Lisa didn't vote for him, and I didn't vote for him--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I voted for Prell to go back to the old glass bottle. After that, I became deeply cynical.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, look at those phonies, sucking up to Bush.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I guess you might say he's barking up the wrong bush. Heh heh heh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, man, I've only got one minute 'til they stop serving those Breakfast Balls...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, jerk! Move your fanny!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey! My taxes paid for that horn!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right. His story checks out. Marge, would you love me more if I were president? 'Cause I'll do it if it will make you happy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, you can always depend on that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"He spanked you? You, Bart Simpson?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"First Bush invades my home turf, then he takes my pals, then he makes fun of the way I talk... probably..., now he steals my right to raise a disobedient, smart-alecky son! Well, that's it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Bush! Get out here!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm going to punch George Bush in the face!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You owe me an apology!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh? Hiding behind your goons, eh, Bush? Oooh! Well, you are a wimp.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I want trouble all right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, you're gonna get trouble.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then we're agreed. There'll be trouble.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Trouble it is.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is gonna be sweet. Two hundred bottle rockets and George Bush doing toe touches by an open window.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yoo hoo?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's your sons, George Bush Jr. and Jeb Bush. Come outside, Dad!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, son! Give him the glue!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,He's not lost.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's time to hit him where he lives.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bingo.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So I thought to myself, what would God do in this situation?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's all in the Bible, son! It's the Prankster's Bible!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"For the last time, Bush, apologize for spanking my boy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You didn't tell me you destroyed his memoirs! Never!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, brought some of your commie friends to help you fight dirty, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Woo hoo! In your face, Bush! Now apologize for the tax hike.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Former President Gerald Ford? Put 'er there! I'm Homer Simpson.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do I ever!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, Mr. Ford!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Jerry, I think you and I are gonna get along just fi--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, he wants that corn so much!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sit down! / You're breaking -- / Don't touch that--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yay!! We're getting a new TV!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look at these low, low prices on famous brand name electronics!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know a genuine Panaphonics when I see it. And look, there's Magnetbox and Sorny.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sold! You wrap it up, I'll start bringin' in the pennies.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You look great.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Spurlock's Cafeteria it is.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's the point of going out? We're just gonna wind up back here anyway.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But Sipowicz does it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I wish I was Sipowicz.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Simpson family.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, c'mon, kids, let's go sit in the car 'til your Mom's done fitting in.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You should've held out longer, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, Marge, you must've really done a number on those rich suckers.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's one way.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not an issue.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, did you know that Kennedy and Lincoln had the same handicap?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just slap some bumper stickers on it and come to bed, willya, Marge?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Seat down.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, this game could mean big things for me, Marge. If I beat Mr. Burns, I mean really wallop him bad... I'm sure to get that big raise I've been gunning for.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good morning, Mr. Burns. Beautiful day to be outside, isn't it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoooooooooo--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mmm, open-faced club sand wedge...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He got to the green in one shot?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How - can - that - old - man - hit - SO - FAR?!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And what are you doing with his ball?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And all those other balls?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"These aren't reptile eggs! You've been cheating! No matter where Mr. Burns hits the ball, you put a fresh one on the green!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So you're not the best golfer here! Wait'll I tell everyone about this! You stink!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bull-honkey! I don't care about joining this stupid club.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm driving up to the main building. They've got valet parking tonight.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, valets. For once, maybe someone will call me ""Sir,"" without adding ""you're making a scene.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm gonna regale everyone with my anecdote. You know, the one I tried to say on the radio? Heh, heh, who's gonna bleep me this time?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I just won't say anything, okay, honey?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You kids should thank your mother. Now that she's a better person, we can see how awful we really are.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Our savings?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"They have beer and gum, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Poor Aunt Hortense... woo-hoo... woo-hoo...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, luckily, there's no such thing as ghosts.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, there's no such thing as ghosts.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Best night's sleep I ever had.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um, I'll have four Tax Burgers, one IRS-Wich -- withhold the lettuce -- three dependent-sized sodas and a FICAccino.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey Marge -- what were your gambling losses last year?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, even with all his problems, he's still willing to do something unbelievably dangerous just to entertain his fans.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, son. I'm sure he's up in Heaven right now, laughing it up with all the other celebrities -- John Dillinger, Ty Cobb, Joseph Stalin... I wish I were dead.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't let Krusty's death get you down, boy. People die all the time. Just like that. Why, you could wake up dead tomorrow. Well, good night.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, they need volunteers to play old-timey people in the parade. Look, I can be a butter churner, a typhoid carrier... an apprentice! I think I'll be an apprentice, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's for my master to decide.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You think so?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah! Well, if you kids believe in me that much, I'll give it my best shot.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You su-diddily-uck, Flanders! Gimme that!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hear ye! Hear ye! Ye olde town crier proclaimed crappy by all! Chooseth Homer Simpson and he shalt rock thy world!,,,,,

Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hear ye, hear ye! What's for breakfast?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't understand thee, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No tongue, eh? How did he talk and eat and laugh and love?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, that'd do.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The dastard!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I believe you, honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Of course I do. You're always right about this type of thing, and for once, I want in on the ground floor.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, nice talking to you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lisa?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I've been called a greasy thug too, and it never stops hurting. So here's what we're gonna do: grease ourselves up real good, and trash that place with a baseball bat.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But you have proof! We could go get that confession out of Jebediah's fife.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, we can use the baseball bat to smash open the case.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Town Crier. I'd like to ask you a few questions. One: where's the fife, and two: give me the fife.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah? Well, put this in your fife and smoke it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, sure I do. I always believe in helping the little guy, and you're the littlest guy I know.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, it's Homer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm just waitin' for my kid.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, well, that's not gonna stop us. I know a much better way to get attention...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hear ye, hear ye, my daughter has something to tell you about Jebediah Springfield.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"DIG HIM UP! Dig up that corpse!! If you really love Jebediah Springfield, you'll haul his bones out of the ground to prove my daughter wrong!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dig up his grave! Pull out his tongue!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What do we win if the tongue is there?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What a jip.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hear ye, hear ye, everybody makes mistakes. Let's go home.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No! Nooooooo!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it's not your fault, honey. I'm supposed to be the responsible one. I shouldn't have let you let me get carried away.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get lost!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hear ye, HEAR YE, HEAR YE!!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right! Liver!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think Smithers picked me because of my motivational skills. Everyone always says they have to work a lot harder when I'm around.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um, is this the chair I'll be sitting on?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh-huh. But this is the chair, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mr. Burns has a mother!? She must be a hundred million years old!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Heh, heh. Taft, you old dog...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, Mr. Smithers? I don't understand 2700 of my new duties.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um, what do I do in case of fire?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just my luck.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, Smithers already left, Sir. I'm his replacement, Homer Simpson.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I think the dodo went extinct...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh-huh, uh-huh, okay. Um, can you repeat the part of the stuff where you said all about the things? The things?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lousy two-legged pants.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I know. I'm taping it. I want to get to Mr. Burns' house bright and early to make his breakfast.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmmm. One of these must be a breakfast maker.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, it's my job to cook him breakfast, and I'm gonna cook the best damned breakfast he ever ate!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... they all won.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, you can either get up or go back to sleep.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, Sir, I did.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The accounting department is located on the third floor. Its hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The head of this department is a Mr. Johnson or Johnstone.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here are your messages: ""You have 30 minutes to move your car,"" ""You have 10 minutes,"" ""Your car has been impounded,"" ""Your car has been crushed into a cube,"" ""You have 30 minutes to move your cube.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hello. Mr. Burns' office.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's Mr. Smithers. He's calling for you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes! Yes, sir!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll have it on your desk in the morning, sir.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No time, Marge. I think Mr. Burns wants me to do some long division.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yello?... It's for you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Except... I killed Mr. Burns.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I punched Mr. Burns right in his 104 year-old face.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mr. Burns?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm really sorry I hit you, Mr. Burns. Here, let me put some salt on that eye.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, sir.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hi, Mr. Burns. Do you want your coffee now?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, can I at least drive you home, Mr. Burns? It's five o'clock.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Would you like me to shred those environmental reports for you, sir?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Burns, is there anything at all I can do for you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You shouldn't've gone away on vacation.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I just feel terrible about getting Mr. Smithers fired. That job was all he had. Imagine how you'd feel, Marge, if you got fired from the... those things... that you do.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Smithers, wait!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You can't let yourself end up in a place like this. You've got two choices: You can give up on yourself and take the Barney-guarding job, like so many of us have contemplated in our darkest moments. Or you can admit to yourself there's only one person that can make you happy and do whatever it takes to get them back.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, I gotcha covered.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're on.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Got it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm transferring a call into you, Mr. Burns.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, Mr. Burns? This is your mother.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, this is Mrs. Burns! I just called to say I don't love you. You are a bad son, Montel!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You really blew it this time, Smithers.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll show you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,For knocking Mr. Burns out a third story window.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What am I -- a doctor?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bye, kids. On your way back, pick up a six pack of beer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, why can't they just take the gun?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Will do.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, nertz.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Which one's Itchy? The car?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh. I guess that's not him then.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it's just Bart and a mysterious stranger.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right... Wait a minute. For what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Forget it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay. Grampa.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Woo hoo! Look, Marge! A couple of bucks!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What for?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh... Forget it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, it's not quite a mop, and it's not quite a puppet, but, man... So to answer your question, I don't know.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, who'd've thought he'd turn out to be such a weirdo?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, his bizarre ""personal"" life? Those weird things they say he does down at the aquarium? Why I heard...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Troy McClure? He's a washed-up movie star. He could be dating washed-up supermodels.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I love legitimate theater.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Down in front!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know! I know! It's Selma, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, hell. Well... What about Dracula?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Troy, buddy, I gotta know. What's a great guy like you wanna marry a guy like Selma?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, look what I snagged, Marge -- the candy bride and groom from the wedding cake.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmmm... pointy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That reminds me -- Troy said something interesting last night at the bar. Apparently he doesn't really love Selma and the marriage is just a sham to help his career. Well, enough talk. Let's snuggle.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, could you close your eyes? I'm trying to sleep.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,'Cause they won't hire an assistant.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Donut?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This has purple stuff inside. Purple is a fruit.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh... Oh -- this is a map of nuclear sites around the country. As a safety inspector, I am responsible for changing most of these light bulbs.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm sorry. I guess watching me isn't any more exciting than being me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, this is a lot more fun with a second person!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Diablo Canyon 2... Why can't you be more like Diablo Canyon 1?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hi, Lisa. How's your Spring Break going?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, owls, eh? So you probably wouldn't want to spend another day at work with me...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You made it! Did you have any trouble getting past the security guards?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Great! Ya wanna get some lunch?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The way I figure it, if the candy stays in the machine for more than a year, it's up for grabs.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, it's a two-man operation, and you're the only man here I trust. Ready?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They all have hilarious names and are delicious.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, Lisa, with you here this hardly seems like work at all. I don't know how I'm gonna make it through my nightshift without you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that'd be great! Sleeping bags on the floor, a roaring fire... It'll be just like the time they kicked me out of the sporting-goods store.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Eh... Truth. Ask me anything.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, dare.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, I'd like to speak with a Mr. Snotball? First name, Ura?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What?! How dare you! If I find out who this is, I'll staple a flag to your butt and mail you to Iran!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, your turn.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ummm... Do you have a crush on anyone?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I won't tell anybody.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe thinks he knows a lot more than Moe knows! Well, just give me another chance, and I'll prove I can keep your secrets.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I have no idea who that is.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I've already forgotten his name. It was Larsen something, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What's wrong, honey?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, you don't have to tell me, but I thought we trusted each other with our secrets now. I mean, I haven't told a soul about your new boyfriend.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I promise.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, that's a real pickle. Would you excuse me for a moment?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, I have thought this through. I will send Bart the money to fly home, and then I will murder him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, we'll work this out together. First things first: where is Knoxville?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, maybe we could order something from Oak Ridge...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Y'ello, Oak Ridge? This is Springfield Nuclear. We need to order a... uh...T-437 Safety Command Console.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And have it sent to the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, care of Homer J.--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Forget the name Homer Simpson. Have it sent care of... Langdon Alger.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Helms Calls for Donut Tax?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,There. Done and done.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, why did I have to stop at the railroad tracks? Better get some change.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's okay. It's okay. I'm back. See, Daddy's here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, Maggie, maybe if you just squeeze a little...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's it, that's it, I...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay. Okay. Think, Homer...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,... The dog!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay! Go, boy! Go find help! Go find help, boy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, bad dog! Bad dog!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, don't worry, Maggie! I'll think of something!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maybe it's time we put Grampa in a home.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Second class? What about Social Security, bus discounts, Medic-Alert jewelry, Gold Bond powder, pants all the way up to your armpits, and all those other senior perks? Oh, if you ask me, old folks have it pretty sweet.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who is it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart's room.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where are you two going at this hour?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, can I come?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pass.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Looks like bad news for the... ...""Impson"" family.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Let's all calm down. Everyone's going to be just fine, as long as I've got enough beer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, that does it. If I'm gonna be trapped inside the house I gotta go out and buy some beer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now to drop gracefully through the windshield.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm sick of these constant bear attacks! It's like the freakin' country bear jamboroo around here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey -- if you want wild bears eating your children and scaring away your salmon, that's your business. But I'm not gonna take it! Who's with me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,WE'RE HERE! WE'RE QUEER! WE DON'T WANT ANY MORE BEARS!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I heard it at the Mustache Parade they have every year.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Mayor, I hate to break it to you, but your city is infested with bears.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ahh, not a bear in sight. The bear patrol must be working like a charm.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thank you, Honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, how does it work?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-huh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-huh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, I want to buy your rock.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Woo-hoo! A perfect day -- zero bears, and one big fat hairy paycheck!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey... how come my pay is so low?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bear Patrol Tax: $5?! What?! This is an outrage! It's the biggest tax increase in history!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let the bears pay the bear tax. I pay the Homer Tax.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, anyway, I'm still outraged.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Open your eyes, Lisa. Our schools are so jam-packed with immigrants, kids like Bart have lost the will to learn.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, when those immigrants get deported, there'll be more elbow room for regular Joes like you and me, Apu.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You? Pfft. I don't believe it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my God. I got so swept up in the scapegoating and fun of Proposition 24, I never stopped to think it might affect someone I cared about.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know what, Apu... I am really, really gonna miss you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah. Those are exactly my sentimonies.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Low and lazy, so -- Hey! Say something again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you got rid of that goofy sacred elephant statue.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't forget Ganesha.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow. You must love this country more than I love a cold beer on a hot Christmas morning. Darn it, Apu, I'm not gonna let them kick you out!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I never should have bought this button. Can I have my three dollars back?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Marge, look what I brought home.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, Marge. Apu convinced me that Proposition 24 is a big mistake.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I'm not registered!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, Selma? Selma my dear? How are you? Uh-huh... uh-huh... uh-huh... Listen, shut up for a second. How would you like to marry Apu so he doesn't get deported?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh. It can't be that many. C'mon, Apu. I'll be your tutor.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Please identify this object.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Correct. Now we all know the thirteen stripes are for good luck. But why does the American flag have precisely 47 stars?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... partial credit.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, they may ask you to locate your town on a map of the U.S, so let's do that. Uh, Springfield, Springfield... Ah, right here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no, and no. Maybe we should start all over with the electrical college.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sleep is for the weak, Apu! Now I'm gonna go to bed while you look over my notes from ninth grade history.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, native Americans like us.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hi, everyone. If I could just say a few words... I'd be a better public speaker.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now that you're all relaxed... Most of us here were born in America. We take this country for granted. But not immigrants like Apu. While the rest of us are drinking ourselves stupid, they're driving the cabs that get us home safely...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They're writing the operas that entertain us every day...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"They're training our tigers, and kicking our extra points... These people are the glue that holds together the gears of our society.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If we pass Proposition 24, we'll be losing some of the truest Americans of all.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"When you go to the polls tomorrow, please -- vote ""NO"" on Proposition 24!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,NO ON 24! NO ON 24! NO ON 24! NO - ON - TWEN - TY - FOUR!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,When are people going to learn -- Democracy doesn't work!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well we'll have to organize a carpool. Every day will be like a road trip!... With your dad!... To school!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So how 'bout those rainbow suspenders, huh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Pretty cool way to keep your pants up, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I see these kids now with ""jive"" printed on their shirts. Now, I can teach you how you're supposed to say ""jive""...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm watching the road, sweetie. ""You jiiive turkey!"" See? You got to ""sass"" it. ""Quit jiiiving me, turkey!"" You gotta ""sass"" it. A turkey is a bad person.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But this is Grand Funk Railroad! You guys back there know Grand Funk, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nobody knows the band, Grand Funk? The wild shirtless lyrics of Mark Farner? The bong-rattling bass of Mel Schacher? The competent drumwork of Don Brewer? Oh, man.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"For more information on Grand Funk, consult your school library!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And when I listen to a really good song, I start nodding my head, like I'm saying ""yes!"" to every beat. ""Yes, yes, yes this rocks!"" And then sometimes I switch it up like ""No, no, no, don't stop a-rockin'...""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I'm not. I'm teaching you about rock music.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now -- Grand Funk Railroad paved the way for Jefferson Airplane, which cleared the way for Jefferson Starship. The stage was now set for the Alan Parsons Project, which I believe was some sort of Hovercraft...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm just trying to party with you guys.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hi there! Been a while since I set foot in Good Vibrations Music. Where can I find the latest releases by ""Bread?""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oldies?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But you've got all the top bands in here. Styx? I just heard them on ""The King Biscuit Flour Hour."" Now here are some of your no-name bands: Sonic Youth, Nine Inch Nails, Hullabalooza...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There can only be one truly great music festival a lifetime, and it's the US Festival.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The US Festival! Geez! It was sponsored by that guy from Apple Computers.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why do you need new bands? Everyone knows rock attained perfection in 1974. It's a scientific fact.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Back then, we didn't care what anyone thought, and the chicks found that irresistible.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But most of all, I remember the music.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You make me feel like dancing...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You wouldn't understand, Dad. You're not with it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No way, man. We're gonna keep on rocking forever... forever... forever...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Forever... forever... forever...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I went to the record store today, and they were playing all this music I'd never heard of. It was like the store had gone crazy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's fine for you, Marge. But I used to rock and roll all night and party ev-a-ry day. Then it was every other day. Now I'm lucky if I can find half an hour a week in which to get funky. I've got to get out of this rut and back into the groove!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I did? I must be getting forgetful in my old age. Open the glove compartment and fetch me my brain medicine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well... what have we here? Looks like your un-cool dad scored tickets to Hullabalooza.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're not going to school today. Today, your classroom will be the Capitol City Amphitheater. Your teacher? Four dozen rock bands. So get ready for some well-supervised craziness while you rock out with your father. Woo hoo!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, my homemade Kahlua.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, a freak show!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I get it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I've been safari-in' since before you were born.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, excuuuuuuse me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, Homer, this is it. Time to get back with the people. The young people.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Alright. Yeah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Cool concert, am I right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What did I say? What's going on?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, I'm heading out now! More butt support! More butt support!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it makes no sense. I haven't changed since high school and suddenly I'm uncool. I've been kicked out of paradise.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll never be part of the scene again!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm fine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't think I have a choice, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How do you figure?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, Marge, in some ways you and I are very different people...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hi, everybody. Is everybody... good?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thank you. Thank you very much.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Stay in school. Your hero, Homer.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Homer Simpson, smiling politely. You know, my kids think you're the greatest. And thanks to your gloomy music they've finally stopped dreaming of a future I can't possibly provide.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,All is well on tour with America's most popular alternative music festival...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Our first job is to entertain...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,...and I like to think sometimes we get a message across as well.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But the main thing is, I've finally tapped into that spirit of self-destruction that makes rock 'n' roll the king of musics.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, ticket-holders!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thank you! And remember: Don't trust anyone over thirty. And now, Peter Frampton!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Really? Me, too. But I got kicked out 'cause of my views on Vietnam. Also, I was stealing projectors.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Anyway, get ready, beer belly! We're gonna show Springfield what we're made of!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That was odd.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No biggie. I'm cool.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Rules. I'm a rocker. I don't care for rules.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Die? Well, you don't scare me, Doc. 'Cause dying would be a stone groove. Got any messages for Jimi Hendrix?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"People know your name, but you don't know theirs. It's great.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nope.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, the one with all the well-meaning rules that don't work out in real life -- Christianity.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's with all the questions?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sure, we've got a lotta catchin' up to do.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,...so I realized that being with my family is more important than being cool.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, this is heavy. Okay, Homer, don't fear the Reaper.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'm gonna die.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge. I thought I had an appetite for destruction, but all I wanted was a club sandwich.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You have a desk?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll miss you Pumpkins, but I just can't share your bleak world view. I've got too much to live for.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know what the song says, ""It's hip to be square.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So lame that it's cool?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait, Marge. Maybe if you're truly cool, you don't need to be told you're cool.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I only get two weeks of vacation a year -- and you want me to spend it in your lousy beach house?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Deal. See, Flanders, you give a little, you get a little.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, let's go!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey. Hmm, somebody's travelin' light.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I have been eating more...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bye-bye, job.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Wel-diddly-elcome Simpsons."" Oh, geez. He actually wrote ""diddly.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I left a few helpful notes around the house...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll take that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I forgot my swimsuit, too. But I improvised.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hello.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's low tide, boys.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, Captain of the Football Team! He's a dreamboat! Don't wait up, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You've got friends. You got ""The Dud"" right here. Stand up for yourself, Poindexter!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmm. I bet this place sells illegal fireworks. Just go in and act casual, like you buy 'em all the time.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um... let me have one of those porno magazines... a large box of condoms... a bottle of Old Harper... a couple of those panty shields... and some illegal fireworks... and one of those disposable enemas. No, make it two.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This baby's sure to kill something. Okay, now everybody -- stand back while I celebrate freedom. Bart, give me your matches.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No lighter?... Nothin'?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait, I got it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The beer!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sweet merciful crap! My car!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, get a last look at the beautiful ocean scenery, kids.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, yeah. I'll go feed it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fish heads, fish heads, do de do de doo...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No more questions. I work my butt off to feed you four kids and all you do I -- what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, three nosy kids. And you know what happens to nosy kids who ask too many questions?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"See, Marge? Who needs a car wash when you can just drive around in the rain.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my God, Marge, it's escaped!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, please. Yes, Bart, you have a twin brother. You see, when you were born, there was... an irregularity.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We chained Hugo up in the attic like an animal and fed him a bucket of fish heads once a week.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We'll search out every place a sick, twisted, solitary misfit might run to.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Right. Bart, you stay home and tape the hockey game.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lookin' good, son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ahh, the ole fishin' hole. So peaceful and relaxing, it doesn't even matter if I catch a single fish.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, you stupid fish! Take the bait! Don't make me come down there!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the-- whosa-- sonofa-,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my God... space aliens! Don't eat me! I have a wife and kids! Eat them!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I suppose you'll want to probe me. Well, might as well get it over with.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I guess you mean President Clinton. He usually hangs around Washington, D.C.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Except... um, there's this election next week, so after that it might not be him anymore. It might be what's-his-name, uh, Mumbly-Joe... uh, I saw him on TV the other... Uh, Bob Dole.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh no. Aliens... bio-duplication... nude conspiracies... Oh my God! Lyndon LaRouche was right!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No! NO! What are you spraying me with!?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, Marge! There I was, I had just caught the largest fish you'd ever seen, when I was abducted by a flying saucer!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's one of the creatures!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,These candidates make me want to vomit in terror! I've got to stop them!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stop! Those candidates are phonies!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You heard me -- They're alien replicons from beyond the moon!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, why won't anybody believe my crazy story?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hold on guys. I'll help ya!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm Homer Simpson, Sir, and I'm gonna get you back to Washington before it's too late!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh no! What have I done? What am I doing? What will I do?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's in Cypress Creek. Upstate somewhere.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah. So long, Stinktown.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"America, take a good look at your beloved candidates! They're nothing but hideous space reptiles!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't blame me. I voted for Kodos.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge! I've got a new job! It's with Globex Corporation. I get more money plus health benefits, for me and my life partner. And they'll move us and give us a nice house and...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Of course not. I wouldn't do that. Why not?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, this is a chance for me to fulfill my lifelong dream.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Promise not to laugh? I always wanted to own the Dallas Cowboys.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just bring the rut with you, honey. Come on, take a look.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, let's watch something else.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah, that's right. Let's watch this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well! What do you think of me and Cypress Creek now, Marge?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thank you! Come again!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We'll never sell this rotten dump.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Heeeeey...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okily dokily.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm gonna miss Springfield. This town's been awfully good to us.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here we are, 15201 Maple Systems Road... Our new home.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow! My boss!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, once.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wowww.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes sir, I will notice that. Very casual, Mr. Scorpion.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... to work for you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Um... Someday I'd like to own the Dallas Cowboys.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ye... No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't worry. That won't take long.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Doh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you guys working?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Could you, um... work any harder than this?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, call me Homer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's with you sad sacks?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Scorpio says productivity is up 2%, and it's all because of my motivational techniques, like donuts and the possibility of more donuts to come.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Tom Landry's hat! And it's autographed! ""To Berman's Dry Cleaning, Best Wishes, Tom Landry.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't buy that. Only management type guys with big salaries like me can afford things like that. Guys like me? I'm a guy like me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, team, it's the fourth quarter. The Lord gave us the atoms, and it's up to us to make 'em dance!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, if Tom Landry's hat doesn't motivate you, then I should just quit right now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Tired, eh? What you guys need... is hammocks.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right... What's the number?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sir, I need to know where I can get some business hammocks.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-huh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Got it...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Umm-hmmm...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Right...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, the Hammock District.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Any sugar around here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... yessir. No problemo.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,France.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've never noticed this office before.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh, you have any sugar around here?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Eh... I... no.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Aargh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I tackled a loafer at work today.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, the Simpson men are doing fine, right, Bart? You haven't even gotten in trouble at school.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What?! We've got it great here. And for the first time in my life, I'm actually good at my job. My team is way ahead of the weather machine and germ warfare divisions.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, I've got a problem, Hank.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, it's pretty important.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Say, what's going on?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, those jerks. Always walking over the small businessman. Don't get me started about the government.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, my family wants to move back to Springfield.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nothing big. It's just a lot of little things.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well... Thanks for everything, Hank.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Project Arcturus couldn't have succeeded without you. This will get you a little closer to that dream of yours. It's not the Dallas Cowboys, but it's a start. Drop me a line if you're on the East Coast, Hank Scorpio.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, the Denver Broncos.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah yeah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You just don't understand football, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, Marge! They opened a new high-tech gadget store! You love high-tech gadgets!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Like bull you don't! Come on!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I'm not!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, look!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The World's Best Jacket! If I had this it would show everybody... show everybody!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what happened to your belt?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, there's only one thing punks like that understand: squealing. You've got to squeal to every teacher and every grown-up you can find. Coming to me was a good start.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yesss, they are a clever bunch. I know, I'll squeal for you. To their parents.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The thing is -- oof! -- Bart really loves that belt and -- ugh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Big deal. I didn't even get my kid's belt back. The only thing a loser like me is good for is taking beatings.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dressing?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You really think I could do it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,YES!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow! I've never been in here before!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You used to be a boxer just like me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's this?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know Lucius Sweet? He's one of the biggest names in boxing! He's exactly as rich and as famous as Don King, and he looks just like him, too.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why not?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lousy Democrats.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No problemo.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, why me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just a second.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right... Ready... Wait a minute... All right... Wait a minute... Just a sec...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then I can just push him over.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No one.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Never.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nothing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Brawled his way up from the boxcars, did he?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Gee, thanks, Moe... What's this?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You... didn't?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, sure.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, ""General!"" Who's Drederick Tatum, anyway? Is he another hobo?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I trust you, Moe. If you say I can beat this guy, then he doesn't stand a chance.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, well... I was gonna surprise you, but, um... happy anniversary, baby!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, c'mon, I'll make a fortune for one night's work! We could have all the things we always dreamed of: a snooty butler, carpeted car ports, those blue cupcakes they sell sometimes --",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, will you let me finish? ...Plug-in room deodorizers, front and rear spoilers for the car --",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I don't think it's that unlikely.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, I think we've heard just about enough from Mr. Newspaper today.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gotcha.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, Homer, nothing to be worried about... just--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you an angel?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But you stopped the fight. Won't everyone be mad at you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aaar, matey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't remember where we parked.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh, not mine.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where are you going?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, they won't learn anything about apples today.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Twenty of the suckiest minutes of my life.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can't they get a pole for that sign?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, let's pick him up!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And what if he's not? Then we'd look like idiots.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yes we are!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yes, there is!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And I think it's the best idea I've ever had! We're picking up the weirdo, and that's final.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,He made fun of my weight.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you're that hitchhiker! What are you doing here?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, that's really lazy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So lazy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...and Larry and I have so much in common, Marge, way more than you and me. If I could be stranded on an island with anyone, it would definitely be Larry!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why? It's not like anything interesting happened to anyone else today.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, sir. I do.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, all the time! Have you ever heard of this kid Milhouse? He's a little wiener who...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh, I should go.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's so unfair. You're everything a dad could hope for.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Larry, there's only one sure way to make him realize how much he loves you. And that... is a phony kidnapping.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pho-ny kid-napping...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hiding out? Marge, you've been reading too many hideout books.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Of course not. We'll decide that on a drifter-by-drifter basis.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, Mr. Burns, this is the kidnapper. Do you miss your son?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If you really love Larry, prove it and you can have him back today.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't you care about your son? This is more important than money!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just a second.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, it's not a real kidnapping. It's a simple hoax to win a father's love.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Still?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What... But... Marge, it's broad daylight and there's cops everywhere!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The abandoned warehouse!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid economic recovery!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We've gotta find someplace no one will ever go. Hel-lo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Heh-heh, they'll never look for us here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You don't like it, call the cops!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It'll be okay, honey. There's lots more oil where that came from.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hold on, Mr. Burns. Maybe we did fake a kidnapping, but is that really such a crime? All your son wanted was a little attention, a little love.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm a father myself, sir. And sure, sometimes my kids can be obnoxious... or boring... or stinky --",,,,,
Homer Simpson,-- but they can always count on one thing: their father's unconditional love.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's a party, Marge. It doesn't have to make sense.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, sorry. My fault.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Someone found my keys!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No problem... Can do.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Right... Uh huh... Gotcha... Cat in the furnace.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A whole week of just father and son! See you at dinner.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, I don't know.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right. Just wake me up.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, but at least rinse your mouth out with soda.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Geez, look at this place. We gotta do something.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do I have to sit up?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Knock yourself out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just a minute!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hello.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I have misplaced my pants.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"'Preciate the suggestion, lady, but he hates that. And I gotta live with him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No! Wait! Wait! Madam, I run a house of discipline. The boy will be disciplined, and disciplined severely. Good day.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I don't know how to punish you! What does Marge usually do?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, boy. Give your old man a little credit.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, well, I still get to punish you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, you're gonna do chores for that lady until you work off the damage you did. It's called responsibility.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I told you last night, no! Where is Bart, anyway? His dinner's getting all cold and eaten.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, where are you?! Come on! I have to be up at six a.m. to swipe Flanders' newspaper!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What the... ""President Eisenhower celebrates 40th wedding anniversary... Not pictured: Mrs. Eisenhower.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't care if he was filling in for Mel Zetz! He's my son and I don't want him --,,,,,
Homer Simpson,working... so... late... that...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, everyone loves rules...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah, drugs. Ya gotta have drugs.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, this isn't gonna be about Jesus, is it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Helen, as a responsible parent, I was already well aware of that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no?! Well, if Homer Simpson wants his ten-year-old son working in a burlesque house, then Homer Simpson's ten-year-old son is going to work in a burlesque house! That's...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No! I only learned that four days ago.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I was trying to punish him exactly like you would. So, in a way, you really dropped the ball on this one. This is your mess and I'll be damned if I'm gonna clean it up!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't you worry, son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My friends! Stop!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sure, we could tear this house down...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No! My friends! Stop!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Let me finish. We could tear it down, but we'd be tearing down a part of ourselves...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You could close down Moe's or the Kwik-E-Mart, and nobody would care / But the heart and soul of Springfield's in our Maison Derriere...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What are you doing, Marge? Didn't you hear the song?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Take it off!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Easy...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, can't we get some clear plates? I can't see the TV.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yoink.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Keep it down in there, everybody.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yup, pretty much. Except we drove around in a van solving mysteries.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I hate having parties. The toilet always gets backed up.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, we can't afford that. Who do you think I am, Liz Taylor?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, we're not talking about a toothbrush here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whaaaaaat?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I just gotta put my shoes on.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know what you two need? A little comic strip called ""Love Is."" It's about two naked eight year olds who are married.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shut up and let the woman talk.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Boring!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, here we go!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's a door?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"G'night... Thanks for coming... We'll see you... Ba-bye... Well, I think that went pretty well.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, please, that was twenty minutes ago.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You can't keep blaming yourself. Just blame yourself once and move on.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The one down the hall.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I sleep in a big bed with my wife.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thanks for introducing me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the hell is wrong with you?!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,For what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't wanna go to that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That doesn't sound like something I'd say.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay. Love you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Can I Borrow A Feeling? ""Can I Borrow A Feeling?"" There's your picture on the front.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I already did.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah. You gotta do that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, and for yourself.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It can't just be sex. It can't.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, that's tough, pal. But it's never going to happen to me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,'Cause Marge and I have one thing that can never be broken: a strong marriage built on a solid foundation of routine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm home! Where are you? Are you okay? I don't smell dinner!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Dear Homer,"" aww. ""Sorry you didn't want to join me tonight. I left you hot dogs for dinner. They're thawing in the sink.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, wait! I know you're only eight years old and I don't wanna put a lot of pressure on you, but you've got to save my marriage.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"As you know, there's been a lot of talk about divorce lately, and I think your mom might not be happy with me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,'Cause there's lots of stuff she doesn't know about.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mm-hm.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I knew this would happen. Our whole marriage started off on the wrong foot.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's your advice?! Go to bed!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good morning. You know, Marge, I was thinking about how much I enjoy your interests, so I wandered over to that theater you went to last night. And I bought tickets to their entire season.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look -- ""Mostly Madrigals."" Hey, that might be good. Ooh, ooh, ""An Evening With Philip Glass."" Just an evening? ""Voices of the Elderly Poor.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, of course, my sweet. I'll just make some soothing ocean sounds for you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I wanted to surprise you with a kicky summer 'do. How many husbands would do that for their wives?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ooh! You're feisty. I'm gonna give you a Madonna cut.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I've just made things worse. A few clumsy gestures aren't going to make up for 10 years of neglect. Marge deserves someone who will treat her right. Marge deserves a fresh start.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'd like to file, for divorce.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge? Can you come in here? We need to talk.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, will you marry me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, it's a second wedding, Honey. Our first one was so crummy, I had to make it up to you. I really love you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, we do. I got us a divorce this afternoon.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I didn't want a hokey second wedding like those ones on TV. This one is for real. I want our marriage to be perfect, right from the start, so we don't end up like Kirk and Luann.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait! I want one last chance to enjoy single life.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, ready.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It doesn't matter. All I want to know is: Will you make me the luckiest guy in the world... again?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whaddya mean?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, it was like that when I got here. It really was.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's this thing?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Telemarketing, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I won't.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let me show you how it works. This baby has every phone number in town programmed into it. It automatically calls them one by one and plays my message. Listen.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now we just sit by the mailbox and watch the money roll in!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Tele-panhandling.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Two dollars! It's working!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no you don't!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Will you two shut up?! People are trying to sleep!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lisa's window is the next one!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shut up!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, who shot the auto-dialer? Marge's auto-dialer?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,... Is it... Wah?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Lisa, there's no record of a hurricane ever hitting Springfield.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What is it, boy? Fire? Earthquake? Hippies?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hurricane! Somehow the animals are always the first to know.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'm sure I'd be a third wheel.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I would make it my business to be a third wheel.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, it's the standard Grampa drill. Everybody into the cellar!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Use your main finger on the yellow side and your other finger on the orange side and turn it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All clear, everyone.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Relax. Can't you see how eerily calm it is?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,See? I told you it was over.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmm. I don't remember a bowling alley being th--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"He fell for it! Way to go, Marge!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now that kinda attitude's not gonna get your house back.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Talk to me!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, call us if you need anything.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hope you like it, neighbor. We didn't have the best tools or all the know-how, but we did have a wheelbarrow full of love.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The living and dining rooms... with a lovely flow for entertaining...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh, one out of twenty-five ain't bad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Your beautiful kitchen, Ned. Just as you remember it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, Flanders, what do you think of the house that love built?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, shoot.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I got off pretty easy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Beer! Gimme some beer!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yello? Yes... Mental hospital? I don't know any ""Ned Flanders.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I... What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Ned Flanders, I mock your value system. You also appear foolish in the eyes of others.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Past instances in which I professed to like you were fraudulent.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I engaged in intercourse with your spouse or significant other. Now that's psychiatry! Eh? Eh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, that's it. You just can't insult this guy. You call him a moron and he just sits there, grinning moronly.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know what your problem is, Flanders? You're afraid to be human.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Because humans are obnoxious sometimes. Humans hate things.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, Flanders. There's got to be something you hate. What about mosquito bites?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What about, uh, fluorescent lights?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,See? You like everything.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ned, you so crazy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, why do they have to put all this crud in my newspaper? ""World""... ""The Arts""... ""Religion"" Aha! Here it is: ""Kickin' Back!""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, who cut something out of my paper?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello? Oh, hi, Lenny... No. Why would I need a ride this afternoon?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where? To the big annual what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lenny? Aw, well. If it was big and annual I'm sure they'd have mentioned it in the newspaper.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, it's a lazy dog-dangling afternoon. But something's a little off...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Marge, you don't smoke!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're nuts. I gotta get some fresh air.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What's wrong with you? What are you trying to hide from m-- What's that smell? Onions... Chili powder... Cumin... Juicy ground chuck... It's chili! Oh my God, I'm missing the Chili Cook-Off!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm missing the Cook-Off! It's going on right now and I'm missin' it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look at me! I'm a puffy pink cloud!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, well, of course... everything looks bad if you remember it. Now where are my chili boots? Ah!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, quit naggin' me. I won't have any beer. Geez, why don't you have a cigarette or something?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, we're missing the chili! Less artsy, more fartsy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine. I'll come find you when I'm ready to stop having fun.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupor Pooper.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Five-alarm chili, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"One... two... Hey, what's the big idea?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmmm. A bland, timid entry -- suitable, perhaps, for patients recovering from surgery. Heh, heh, heh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, Chief.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, Wiggy...? My chili's gettin' cold.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hot! Hot!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I need it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, lousy Wiggum. Now the whole town thinks I'm a chili wuss...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Maybe I do, son. Maybe I do.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Outstanding.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"More, please.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, Chief, don't quit your day job... heh, heh, heh... whatever that is.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Heh, heh! My finest hour! And Marge wasn't even here to see it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ooh. I don't feel so good.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Flanders! You gotta help me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What's happening to me? Okay, retrace your steps... woke up, fought with Marge, ate Guatemalan insanity peppers. Then I -- Ohhhh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where am I? Shelbyville?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, Marge! Will you... Fight fair! I never do this to you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man, this is crazy. I hope I didn't brain my damage. I'd better check my pupils...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh... kay. I think I'm gonna be leaving now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Huh? Sunrise, sunset... Sunrise, sunset... SUNRISE, SUNSET / SUNRISE, SUNSET...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Note to self: stop doing anything.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey buddy! Get back there with the other rocks!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh? A tortoise?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Follow... the... This must be why I'm here! Follow the what? Follow the what? Hurry up!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Get moving, you stupid... When I'm kicking you, that means ""hurry up"". Come on!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh. You want me to climb that, huh? No problemo.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This is 'cause I kicked you, isn't it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge! Thank God you're here! Where's the car?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge? Marge? Oh, now what? If you're still mad at me, I'm gonna be really mad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, I hate this place! Why am I here?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who said that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hiya.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If it's about laying off the insanity peppers, I'm way ahead of you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, that's me all right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But what should I do? Should I meditate? Should I get rid of all my possessions?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, I have been meaning to take a spiritual journey, and I would -- Hey!!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Knock it off!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, just gimme some inner peace, or I'll mop the floor with ya.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Soul mate?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's it? Well, that's Marge. Big deal. Great spiritual quest, wolfie. My soul mate is Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, wait! Come back!...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A ghost train! And so little time to get out of the way!... Now less!... Now none!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wha? Golf course? Did I dream that whole thing? Maybe the desert was just this sand trap... Oh, and I bet that crazy pyramid was just the Pro Shop!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Carl?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And that talking coyote was really just a talking dog.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, wait a minute. There's no such thing as a talking dog.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Damn straight.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hi, kids.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where's your mother?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hi, honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh. I guess you're cranky because I didn't come home last night...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, honey, I didn't get drunk. I just went to a strange fantasy world. C'mon, you gotta believe me. You're my soul mate.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That coyote said my soul mate would understand me, but Marge doesn't understand me at all. Maybe we're not kindred spirits. We don't have anything in common...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look at these records! Jim Nabors, Glen Campbell, the Doodletown Pipers! Now look at her records... They stink! Maybe I had that crazy dream for a reason...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wherever my soul mate is, it's not here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...I always just figured my wife was my soul mate. But if it's not Marge, then who is it? Where do I begin looking?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Barney! Soul mate! Let me buy you a beer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well what about you, Lenny?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello? Is this G-B-M? Uh, yeah. I read in the personals you were seeking a soul mate and, well, I also like rainy days and movies. Uh huh... uh, no, I don't like that. Or that. No, it's not that I'm afraid. I'm gonna hang up now. Bye-bye. Oh, I give up.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where? Where?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh. What's that blinking light?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The lighthouse keeper!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The loneliest man in the world! He'll understand me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Earl. My new friend's name is Earl!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here I come, buddy! No more loneliness for Homer and Earl....",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A machine? Earl's a machine. Oh, that's just perfect! Homer's desperate search for a soul mate has yielded a lighthouse-keeping robot! Oh, wow!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Alone! I'm alone! I'm a lonely, insignificant speck on a has-been planet orbited by a cold, indifferent sun!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A ship! A ship with people! I know... I'll bring them to me! And then they'll have to be my friends!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come here, people!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I won't be lonely for long....",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really? You were? But how did you find me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Or that little guy on the ""Don't Walk"" sign.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, Marge, you really do understand me. See, I thought we weren't soul mates because...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Right, and we don't like the same things. It's like you're from Venus...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, sure. Give me the one with all the monsters.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,...But our sames go right down to the bone. Maybe we do have a...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey... we do! Oh, Marge!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We're number one! We're number one! In your face, space coyote!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Omigod! The ship!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The light! We gotta get the light back on!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,They see us! They're starting to turn!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We sure did... soul mate.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"TGIF! Guys, I'm off to Moe's.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, I have a plan. I saw this in a movie about a bus that had to speed around a city, keeping its speed over fifty, and if its speed dropped, it would explode. I think it was called ""The Bus That Couldn't Slow Down."" First, I hook this common VCR into the security camera system like so...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Then, I insert this old videotape of us working on a continuous loop...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nah, it's Friday night Moe. I wanna try something special.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Skoal! Wait a minute -- this is Duff!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmm, bold -- refreshing... and something I can't quite put my finger on.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, it's one a.m. Better go home and spend some quality time with the kids.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh, I guess I'll walk home.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No time for you, old man!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Please, don't hurt me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yaaaa...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It was an alien, Marge! It appeared in front of me and said, ""Don't be afraid!""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No! Well, ten beers...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm telling you, I saw a creature from another planet.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah? Well, when I came to, I was covered with a sticky translucent goo! Explain that!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh. It's Bart. I can't believe it. I'm being mocked... by my own children... on my birthday!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes. Remember, it's the same day as the dog's?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lousy loveable dog.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it was awful. They set me on a cold metal table and prodded me with humiliating probes and the -- oh wait, that was my physical.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The alien has a sweet heavenly voice -- like Urkel! And he appears every Friday night -- like Urkel!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You don't have to humiliate me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I'm sorry.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, the evening began at the Gentleman's Club, where we were discussing Wittgenstein over a game of backgammon.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We were sitting in Barney's car eating packets of mustard. Ya happy?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You are one fine-lookin' woman, lady. If I wasn't married, I'd go out with you like that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I am so sorry. Whatever you do, don't tell Marge. God, I love her. I-- Hey, a penny!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So I says ""Blue M & M, red M & M, they all wind up the same color in the end.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I was standing right here, when the horrible creature emerged from the woods.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge, I've never felt so alone. No one believes me. Uh, this is the part where you're supposed to say ""I believe you, Homer.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You do?! Oh, Marge, you've made me so happy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thanks! I'd love an omelet right about now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I can't. This is my cause. I'm like the man who single-handedly built the rocket and went to the moon. What was his name? Apollo Creed?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I refuse to share a bed with someone who thinks I'm crazy. Unless you're feeling... amorous?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well then, good night!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I suppose you're going to mock me, too.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You do?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thank you, son. And do you think you could stop the casual swearing?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's my boy. Well, if you believe in me, then I'm not going to give up. I'll prove I'm right. This Friday we're going back to the woods, and we're going to find that alien!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We'll fake it and sell it to the Fox network.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now son, they do a lot of quality programming, too.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I kill me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, son, you don't want to drink beer. That's for Daddies, and kids with fake IDs... besides, it's such a beautiful night. How about a ghost story?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No! No! No-o-o-o-o!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, me too.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's him!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"As a representative of planet earth, let me be the first to say...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bwah! Bwah! Bwaaaaah!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's gone. And we still don't have any proof.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good work, son! We did it! We did it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge! Kids! They're about to show my videotape!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, I'm happy to answer any questions you have about the alien. Any questions at all. Doctor Hibbert?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... the second one. Zilliphone. Next question.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, yes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This interview is over!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Take a look at this, Lisa. You don't see any ""Homer is a Dope"" T-shirts, do you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge! How could you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll take two!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look! There it is!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait -- back up a bit now. When are the pancakes coming in the mail?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What do you need to make money for anyway? As long as I have my earning power, this family's got nothing to worry about.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow! Oh! Call work and tell 'em I won't be in tomorrow.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No deal, McCutcheon. That moon money is mine!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, your fish are dead.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, pretzels!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's all that commotion outside? Why, it's one of those Pretzel Wagons the movie stars are always talking about.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's right, Lenny. Let's all give in to deliciousness, the Pretzel Wagon way.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That means thank you, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You could call 'em Whitey Whackers.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge needs help, and God knows, I'm not the man to provide it. But I know who can...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, looks like Mr. Pretzel Man is doing pretty well for himself.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm here to see Mr. Ormand.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I guess I should speak to the executor of his estate.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're my last hope. I've never reached out to you before, but my wife is in her hour of need. Your help could make all the difference in the world.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I had a feeling things would work out for you, honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, Moe.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, my wife is raking it in.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Fat Tony! You still with the Mafia?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You mean the mob only did me a favor to get something in return? Oh, Fat Tony... I will say good day to you, sir.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,In those words? Yes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How could I not? I saw you pouring your heart and soul into this business and getting nowhere. I saw you desperately trying to cram one more salty treat into America's already bloated snack-hole. So I did what I could. I did what any loving husband would do: I reached out to some violent mobsters.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So what are we gonna do?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, thank God. It's only Grampa.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You heard her. She said ""no.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, that little guy hasn't done anything yet.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look at him. He's gonna do something. And you know it's gonna be good!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You must hate me, Marge. Every time I try to help, I just fail miserably.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, that's the fire alarm!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I think I won, Mr. Burns.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hit 'em, Carl! You too, Lenny!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So Burns is going to make us all go on a stupid corporate retreat up in the mountains to learn about teamwork. Which means we'll have to cancel our plans to hang around here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmmm. Your ideas are intriguing to me, and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter, but I think we have to go on the retreat anyway.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, here we are.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... yes sir. I thought I was supposed to.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, I lost my map.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, this sounds like fun.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oooh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, not as such.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, lotta hysteria...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Burns, I insist that we cheat!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow. You sure know how to cheat, Mr. Burns.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No sir. I am not.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That worked sooo well.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No going through the window for us!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, Mr. Burns, you're the richest guy I know. Way richer than Lenny.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, these sure are comfortable chairs.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, man, you are so right. Did you ever sit like this?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why get up? Here's a little move I've been tinkering with. Say I want that bowl of dip.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Use it wisely, my friend.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You got it, buddy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um, I don't see one. Unless...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No. There's no way out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You can supervise me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We sure did!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think when we yelled we caused another avalanche.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shhh! You're causing more avalanches. .,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think they've stopped. .,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It could be days before they find us.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We could build snowmen.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh... Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stay back! I have powers! Uh, political powers!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Agreed.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, they're just snowmen, Mr. Burns.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What do we do?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You and what army?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Burnsie!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Lord, protect this rocket house and all who dwell within the rocket house.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, kids.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You said it, ya weirdo.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, get me a beer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Your mother seems really upset about something. I better go have a talk with her... during the commercial.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge I just had a couple of beers.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Eww.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I was just watching Women's Volleyball on ESPN...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Come on. There's no need for that baba-ma-bushka.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, There's no way I could --",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now sweetie, don't worry about a thing. I'll teach you to comb it over so no one can tell. Just like my hair!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, whatever it takes to make you well, we'll do it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But how am I supposed to pay for that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good for you, son. Giving up smoking is one of the hardest things you'll ever have to do. Have a dollar.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Didn't he Lisa? Didn't he? Hey, wait a minute, he didn't!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, Marge. I'll get you your nanny, and to pay for it... I'll give up the Civil War Re-creation Society I love so much.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute, Marge. I saw Mrs. Doubtfire. This is a man in drag!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're phony! Fakey phony broad!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gimme those.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I like him!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I hide a bottle of Schnapps in the baby's crib.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You have my undivided attention.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,MIGHT I ADD -- NO FAT CHICKS.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,AND ONE WHO WILL WORK FOR MINIMUM WAGE--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Did you say Mary Pop--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now Ms. Bobbins, if you want this job you're going to have to answer a few questions. First, do you have any bad habits?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, so am I.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay. Question two -- who was your last employer?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, do we know them?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Come on -- isn't he the guy I bowl with? The black guy?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah. So, you worked for Carl, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, she is tough.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll say. Her butt waxed the banister.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come to bed, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no. Leave it in.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,NOT TILL YOU'RE FIFTEEN.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, I can't get enough of this blood pudding.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Blood, uch! I'll just stick to the brain and kidney pie, thank you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You've changed me as well. I'm no longer the money-driven workaholic I once was.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shary Bobbins! I want another beer!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You'll find it's even more fun if you get it for me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that poor woman.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nope.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Indubitably!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"AROUND THE HOUSE, I NEVER LIFT A FINGER / AS A HUSBAND AND FATHER I'M SUB-PAR / I'D RATHER DRINK A BEER THAN WIN FATHER OF THE YEAR / I'M HAPPY WITH THINGS THE WAY THEY ARE.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"SHUT UP, FLANDERS.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm sure we will, honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm sure we will.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, hi, Roy. Hey, they're having open casting for the voice of Poochie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I do not!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I prefer to listen to Cheap Trick.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, this is Homer Simpson sayin' ""Howdy"" to all the girls out there in radioland.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, this is Homer Simpson sayin'-- I don't sound like that, do I? Oh, I don't like having such a hilarious voice.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ruff Ruff! I'm Poochie the rockin' dog.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, ""no attitude,"" eh? Not ""in-your-face,"" huh? Well, you can cram it with walnuts, Ugly!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh? I can't. I don't remember what I did.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I don't get the job, do I? Well, boo-hoo, I don't get to be a cartoon dog.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, now I got the job, huh? Oh. Thank you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"She smells sheet smells by the sheet store. Wait, wait. Lemme try it again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You? But you're a lady.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, it really is you! How'd you get to be so good?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You mean ""meep meep""?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, I guess. Is this episode going on the air live?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll field this one. Let me ask you a question: why would a man whose shirt says ""Genius At Work"" spend all of his time watching a children's cartoon show?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the hell are you talking about?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Quiet! You're missing the jokes!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well? What did everybody think?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So it was pretty okay, huh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, at least I liked it. Didn't I?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm the worst Poochie ever.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then they said they were gonna kill Poochie off!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're right, Marge! It's not my fault! I'm not gonna let 'em treat Poochie like dirt anymore just 'cause he's the new guy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Put a sock in it, Roy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No I am not.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Never!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You can't just kill off a classic TV character. Poochie could be bigger than curly fries, but first he has to win back the audience. That's why I'm gonna read these lines I wrote myself with my own two hands.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes. I certainly do. Hello there, Itchy. I know there's a lot of people who don't like me and wish I would go away, but I think we got off on the wrong foot. I know I can come off a little proactive, and for that I'm sorry. But if everyone could find a place in their hearts for the little dog nobody wanted, I know we can make 'em laugh -- and cry -- until we grow old together.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, kids -- I know you loved the old Poochie...but the new one's going to be better than ten Superbowls. I don't want to oversell it. Judge for yourselves.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, that wasn't supposed to happen! Those finks double-crossed me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I guess I learned my lesson. The thing is, I lost creative control of the project. And I forgot to ask for any money. Well, live and learn.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nine hundred dollars? Well, we'll have to dip into the retirement fund again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, nuts. Hel-lo? China? Little help?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That is so true.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What happened?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Give her a break! Her husband was killed!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, so maybe that thing's a hunk of junk, but look at what you're selling!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fifty bucks for a toy? No kid is worth that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No. How can you love a box, or a toy, or graphics? You're a grown man.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah. Like when a clown dies.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And that kind of stuff is worth money?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man, you should come over to our place. It's full of valuable, worthless crap!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I practically insist. Shall we say, 5 o'clock? The snacking hour?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do I know you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow! Why you little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh. I'll just be another minute, John. Have a seat.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, do those records have ""camp value?""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That John is the greatest guy in the world. We've gotta have him and his wife over for drinks sometime.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, a swinging bachelor, eh? Well, there's lots of foxy ladies out there...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Couldn't agree more. Happy as a clam.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who doesn't?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Right...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"OhmyGod! OhmyGod! OhmyGod! OhmyGod! I danced with a Gay! Marge, Lisa, promise me you won't tell anyone. Promise me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Am I, Marge? Am I? Think of the property values! Now we can never say only straight people have been in this house!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whoa, not me. And not because John's gay, but because he's a sneak. He should at least have the good taste to mince around and let everyone know that he's that way.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know me, Marge: I like my beer cold, my TV loud, and my homosexuals fla-ming.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No! No, no, no, no...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no! I'm not setting foot outside this house until that man is gone!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"How'd it go? Tell me everything that happened! He didn't give you Gay, did he? Did he?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, and I'm not.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart! Where'd you get that shirt?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uhh... huh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, the boy was wearing a Hawaiian shirt!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There's only two kinds of guys who wear those shirts -- gay guys, and big fat party-animals. And Bart doesn't look like a big fat party-animal to me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Right. Thank you. I hope you realize this is all your fault. I mean, do you have to be so effeminate around the boy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You! I should have known!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, John, you seem like a perfectly nice guy and all. Just stay the hell away from my family!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know. It's... it's not... usual! If there was a law, it would be against it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No I'm not, Marge! They're embarrassing me! They're embarrassing America! They turned the Navy into a floating joke! They ruined all our best names, like Bruce and Lance and Julian! Those were the toughest names we had, now they're just...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah! And that's another thing! I resent ""you people"" using that word. That's our word for making fun of you. We need it! Well, I'm taking back our word and I'm taking back my son!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Homer storms out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, boy. We're gonna set you straight. By tomorrow morning, you'll be a regular Burt Reynolds.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just a couple of good ol'-fashion manly places. Father and son.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just remember, son, whatever happens --I'll always love you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,... as a father! A father!! A regular father!! Whooh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nothing. Just sit. I'll be back.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well it's been two hours. How do you feel?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's a good start. Let's get you a pack. What's your brand?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, that didn't work. But I know something that will...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, I want you to shake hands with -- what's your name, fella?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Roscoe here runs this mill. He's gonna show us around and let you get a first-hand look at real All-American Joes doin' what they do best.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You'll thank me on your wedding night.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Has the whole world gone insane?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know! This is a nightmare! You're all sick!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ohh, my son doesn't stand a chance! The whole world's gone gay!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, my God, what's happening now?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,...and the entire steel mill was gay!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But what would turn Bart into a man fast? You have to think for me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hunting, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stand aside, Marge. I'm taking the boy deer hunting. He's going to grow up straight for once.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah?! How long since you've had a baby?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It just does! Name me one gay Indian!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Butt out, butt-insky! What would you know about hunting?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hang onto it, Toy-Boy! You might need it when it starts raining naked ladies!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, boy. You can't drive, you're only 10. You're going hunting!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That is a very immature attitude, young man.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well... but... Wait a minute. Bart's not fixed yet! He hasn't even --,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, she'd never go. She's a vegetarian.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No... This whole thing is my fault. I've been a lousy dad.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, boy, wake up! Your old man found some deer!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yep, and it's your shot, son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, Bart. Be a sport and kill Blitzen, okay?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, I'm gonna turn my back -- and when I turn around, I wanna see a whole pile of dead reindeer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Attaway, son! You made your old man proud!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Me too, son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, there comes a time in every father's life when he must -- GAAHHH!!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,UNNGHH!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just... my bones... and organs...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the -- ?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, look! It's Santa Claus!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's a miracle!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've been tenderized.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, we owe this guy. And I don't want you calling him a sissy. This guy's a fruit! And a -- No, wait, wait, wait -- ""queer!"" Queer, queer. That's what you like to be called, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Amen to that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Y'know, Bart, maybe it's just the concussion talking, but any way you choose to live your life is okay with me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"He said ""tried""!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, all those stairs...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Your mother's right, Bart. Sure, you're the one who ruined all of Sideshow Bob's criminal schemes --",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And sure, he's probably so insane with rage that he'd butcher you horribly if he could --",,,,,
Homer Simpson,In a medium-security prison.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Unless he gets out somehow.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Or so you'd think, except he's done it so many times before.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah! You do your own dirty work!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lisa too?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I hope Bob fed you, 'cause I ate your dinners.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm going to look for the kids!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You like parties, huh? Well, I just remembered they're having a big one down at the waterfront this weekend.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The important thing is I didn't imagine it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Militants, huh? Well, if I were you, I'd kick their asses.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, gee, I'd really love to want to help you, Flanders, but uh, Marge was taken prisoner in the... Holy Land and uh...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll have to ask her.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Going to that fancy waterfront party tomorrow.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it's like a rent-a-car, son. You get all the mileage you can. Then ball it up and cram it through the mail slot.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can you see the pie stains?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Take it like a man, boy. And do everything your little sister says.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, I love this pedestrian mall! There's practically no traffic!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, all right, geez. Okay, honey, remember where we're parked.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You've never been?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nah, I'm really more of a slacker.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, Marge! A restaurant owned by celebrities! I always wanted to be a celebrity!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, even Moe's moved to fancy new digs.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, honey, when I think of all the good times we've had together-- AAAGH!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Did you see that, Marge?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't laugh at me! I was once like you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What's the matter, Marge? I thought you loved Jello shooters.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, come on Marge, relax! Lisa's in charge. She's the responsible one.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Give me the drugs, Lisa.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's been St. Patrick's Day for hours and I'm still not drunk yet. Oh, it's never gonna be nine o'clock.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Moe, thank God you're here! We'd like to come in and drink, please!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look at me! I'm the Prime Minister of Ireland!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll come with you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, honey, you're not the world's worst mother. What about that freezer lady in Georgia?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Prohibition! They tried that in the movies and it didn't work. I predict this is the last we'll be hearing about prohibition.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Glad you're finally back in business, Moe.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"At first I thought prohibition was a good thing. People were drinking more and having a lot more fun. But without beer, prohibition doesn't work.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now don't say that! Alcohol is a way of life. Alcohol is my way of life. And I aim to keep it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Maybe I do, Chief. Maybe I do...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, boy, think of a plan.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've got it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We're going out, Marge. If we don't come back, avenge our deaths.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Right. Now remember, don't mention this to anyone. Not your mother, not Rex Banner, not anyone.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Heh, Rex Banner. What a dope.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hang on, son!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really? I heard good.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nothin'.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Before! Before! You're living in the past, Marge! Quit living in the past.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Going bowling. Not back - avenge deaths.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'm not going to lie to you, Marge. So long!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, suck like a fox!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You see, boy, the real money's in bootlegging, not in your childish vandalism.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute. I forgot to make sure the coast was clear. Aw, it's probably clear. Let's go.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I can explain, Marge! Please let me explain! Oh, why won't you let me explain!!!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well -- and I can explain, remember -- I fill the balls with beer that I found at the dump, then I bowl them and some underground pipes take them into Moe's.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It is silly, Marge. And look at all the money I'm making!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No you won't.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Won't.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, boy, get crackin'! Moe upped his order to twenty balls a night!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Call me Beer Baron.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I can't be out of beer. I'm the Beer Baron!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, I'm all out. Wha-- How about some turpentine? Or caulk? Delicious caulk...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Make it,"" eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Forty-two bathtubs, please.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I said forty-two!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Remember, honey, we're disobeying an unjust law here. We're patriots. Like... all those people in jail.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Banner, how's it hangin'?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh... nothing, Marge. I think it must have been that bean I had for dinner.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ka-boom! Blam! Oh, excuse me again, dear.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What, dear?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ka-BLAMMO.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Boom.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll be right back.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's hot!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I thought about what you said, honey, and I've decided to quit.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, well... Fun's over, but I still have my wonderful money.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Geez, what happened to you, Wiggum? You look terrible.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I don't think so. You don't even have a trigger on that thing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Poor Wiggum.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll bet you really hate Rex Banner, huh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The guy who took your job.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, how would you like to show him up by beating him at his own game?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You forgot one thing, Wiggum.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I filled the balls with a funnel.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, probably just a slap on the wrist...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Last time I help you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, sorry, I'm not in that business anymore.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"To alcohol! The cause of, and solution to, all of life's problems!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Alright, men. Get ready to blast off!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wooo, we're in orbit now! What's that? A call from the president? Hello?... Uh, yes. ""Let me just say this about that."" Okay, Mr. President...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mayday! Mayday!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute. Bart's teacher's name is ""Krabappel?"" I've been calling her ""Crandall."" Why didn't someone tell me? Oh, I've been making an idiot out of myself.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Give me that! Bart, this is your father. Do you know where the remote is? I looked all over the house.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It was in... It was in my pocket.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, does this mean that Mrs. Krabappel is a virgin, too?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, mail's here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,When? When? Ich bin hungrig!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes! My precious ""CarTOONS!"" ""Who pumped Ethyl?!""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, mail's here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow! A golf shirt! With my corporate logo on it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hi Marge, hi Santa's Little Helper, hi kid -- hey, that's not Santa's Little Helper.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, I gotta start going to church.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah, a dog like this you have to feed every day.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Geez, that dog has more education than I do. He's some kinda super dog. Hey, where'd he go?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I don't know about this dog. He's kinda... snooty.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do you think he noticed?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No! Bart had his turn, let me! I can't resist his charms.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Crowds give him gas.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, TV's Kent Brockman.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You want some puppies, eh, Mr. Brockman?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'd take him, but those cards are non-transferable.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can do.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Laddie! C'mere, boy! Who want to lick a messy baby?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Laddie?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He better know how to keep his mouth shut.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You gave both dogs away?! You know how I feel about giving!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There, there, shut up, boy. We'll just get you a new dog.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, crying isn't going to bring him back, unless your tears smell like dog food. So you can either sit there, crying and eating can after can of dog food until your tears smell enough like dog food to make your dog come back, or you can go out there and find your dog!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Rats. I almost had him eating dog food.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The bad dog or the good dog?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh good.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I know where there's lots of paper!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, okay.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can Lenny have it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now I can't remember every little thing that happens in my day.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yes! Gather 'round, my son, and I shall tell you a tale...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, the bank put Lenny in charge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, but Daddy doesn't feel so good.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here you go, honey. That's about all the recycling I can handle today.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, why don't you try the old folks home? They practically live in their own filth!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're welcome, honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You mean Maggie?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lisa! You have a guest!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, um, how's life in the gutter?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"See that, boy? Why aren't you making any business deals?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's all right. I understand. But we really could have used that twelve thousand dollars.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Please be Flanders, please be Flanders, please be Flanders...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good one, Mom! / You're so bad, honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Two in a row!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-huh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I hope you learned your lesson, Lisa. Never help anyone.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I made a bad mistake and Lenny sent me home to think about what I did. But I don't remember what it was so I'm watching TV.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'd love to go with you, honey, but I've got a lot of work to do around the bed.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"In that case, he should've made the week an hour longer. Lousy God.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,DAMMIT!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who cares? This is the best part of the week!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It should, but it doesn't. Now who's going with Daddy to the dump?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah. We're gonna get rid of the Christmas tree. It's starting to turn brown.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wanna come with?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's your life.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, Christmas tree.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay. Who's up for some scrounging?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, here's a perfectly good basketball half!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my God! Help me, Lisa!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wh... what's going on? Wh... wha... why am I on a Japanese box?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, my God, what is that?...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why would you volunteer at the church?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Volunteering is for suckers! Do you know that so-called ""volunteers"" don't even get paid?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, I'm obsessed with it! Where did it come from? What is it a box of? How'd my face get on it?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Akira, can you read this for me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hokkaido, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'd like the phone book for Hokkaido, Japan, please.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thank you. May I please use your phone?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Y-y-y-yes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes. This is Homer Simpson from America. Who may I say is speaking to me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, hello? Why am I Mr. Sparkle?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I am Mr. Sparkle!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Put it in! Put it in!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That didn't explain anything. All I know is they stole my face and used it for their stupid ""logo"". There's no other explanation.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, it was a good ride while it lasted. C'mon kids. Let's go home.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That was fast.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks for swinging by the house, Reverend.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Konichi-wa.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, run around in circles!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now that's religion.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can I have this one?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Chair goes round... chair goes round.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know. I'm kind of dizzy. I should probably go home sick.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow. You've got pencils with your name on 'em. Just like a pencil company executive. I'd give anything for one of these.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I didn't even know what a nuclear panner plant was.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you seem like a great guy, so I'll give you a little tip. If you turn that security camera around, you can sleep and no one will ever know.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah, they're always trying to screw ya.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hiya, Stretch! What's the good word?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, Grimy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Check.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So how's it going, Grimy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I wish I had a nickel for every time I've heard that. TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALL GAME / TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALL! So what's new, Grimy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh. A five THIRTEEN. I'll handle it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That got it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Acid, eh? Gee, that would have been stupid. Boy would my face have been red!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,He did.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He likes you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hi, Grimy, old buddy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay. Do I have to do anything?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I can't believe it. I've got an enemy. Me! The most beloved man in Springfield.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I won't accept that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, what'll I do, Moe?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do you think it might work without the fork in the eye?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This dinner has to go absolutely perfect if Grimy and me are going to be friends. Lisa -- be perfect.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge -- perfect. Bart -- perfect. Other kid -- perfect.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no. He doesn't know he's coming to dinner. I didn't think he'd come, so I called and said I had something really important to tell him and that I could only tell him about it here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Welcome-to-the-Simpson-residence-or-Casa-De-Simpson-as-I-call-it-heh-heh-heh-heh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It is. It is. But first let me introduce you to my family. My perfect family.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This is my wife, Marge...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"... and our beautiful baby. My daughter, Lisa -- I.Q. 156.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"See. And my son, Bart -- he owns a factory downtown.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I 'unno. Don't ask me how the economy works.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, that's me all right. And the guy standing next to me is President Gerald Ford. And this is when I was on tour with The Smashing Pumpkins. Oh, and here's a picture of me in outer space.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sure. You've never been?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Would you like to see my Grammy Award?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What are you saying?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The car won't start. And I don't feel very good today. I am at work.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wh-- th-- that's crazy talk. You're crazy, Marge. Get off the road.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No he won't. He hates me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, yeah, that's his problem. He's a nut. It's not about me being lazy, it's about him being a crazy nut!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll do it. To professionalism!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good morning, fellow employee. You'll notice that I am now a model worker. We should continue this conversation later during the designated break period. Sincerely, Homer Simpson.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh. Design your own power plant, eh? This is my chance to show everyone how professional I am.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lenny, tell Mr. Burns I've gone home to work on the contest.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, do we have any elbow macaroni and glue-on sparkles?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, basically I just copied the plant we have now...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then I added some fins to lower wind resistance. And this racing stripe here I feel is pretty sharp.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you okay, Grimy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You wish.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Change the channel, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Over there.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Barney, where's my car?!!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, grrrreetings!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Call me when you get a karaoke machine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm hiding from th-th-th-th-the ghost.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"B-b-before the show, you said we were having a Special Ghost tonight!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's a Tim Conway?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, have you ever imagined what it would be like if we really were beavers?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Honey, I'm home!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's not a plant, Marge, it's a tree, and I've nearly chewed through it. Now remember, my new boss is coming home for dinner tonight.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay. Now, before my boss comes, there's something important you should know --",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But, Marge...!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I know one thing in this world that's still pure and good.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No... Candy! Sweet, sweet candy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I WANT CANDY!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I WANT CANDY!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I wish our special guest Tim Conway didn't have to leave so soon.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, that's all the time we have. So this is the Simpson family saying: ""As you walk down the road of life...""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no! Your room is full of toys. You're going to the, uh, garage!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not very.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm sorry if you heard ""Disneyland"", but I distinctly said ""military school.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If, uh, that happens, are we still charged for the entire semester?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They sure are.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's not so disciplined.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I guess.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Leggo my leg.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, for the last time, you're staying at military school.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge? You got that? Marge?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, go on, boy. Go get it! Answer the phone! Be a good boy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, there's gotta be something on this thing for that thing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, Bart, uh, did you make sure to return all the guns?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, yeah. I've always said the boy could use more confidence.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, kids, we're so proud of the way you completed military school, we thought this time we'd take you to Disneyland for real!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"'Evening, Moe.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You got the black one.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey everybody, I'm Peter Pantsless!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Shut up! It's my car, and I say we're going to the lost city of gold!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Goodnight, Barney. Don't forget to bring back my car back tomorrow. Just slide it under the door.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So you lost my car, eh? Well, that's just grand. I ought to punch you in the nose, but I have to pick up my kids at school.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you can stand there finding fault, or you can knit me some seat belts.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Throw it away! Nothing good has ever come out of New York City!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My vehicle!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I don't want to go to New York City.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"New York is a hellhole, and you know how I feel about hellholes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's time I told you about a chapter of my life I hoped would be closed forever. I was on my way to the Harrisburg Coat Outlet to buy an irregular coat. But it required a stopover in New York City.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All I had to do was walk a few blocks from the Port Authority Bus Terminal to my train at Penn Station...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Anyhow, I must have looked at somebody the wrong way...because the next thing I knew, I was running for my life.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And that's when the CHUDs came at me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lousy Bart... his money... All right, New York, I'm coming back. But you're not getting this!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't you start.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I can't feel my legs!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't feel my legs!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now remember, criminals prey on small-town folk like us. So if anyone asks, we're sophisticated millionaires from the Ozarks.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Good. I don't want to spend one extra second in this urban death-maze. You wait here at the bus station while I get the car.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, all right, but not a minute later -- 'cause once the sun goes down, all the weirdos turn crazy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm on to you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Your vehicle is illegally parked at One World Trade Plaza. Hmmm...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ooohh...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid city! What the hell is this thing?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come off! Come off! Oh, all right, you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"They expect me to sit here from nine to five?! That's how many hours? Ten, eleven, denominator... Oh, where's Lisa when you need her?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Come on! Pick up the pace!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey! I'm not a bum... Thanks, but I don't need... Okay, if you insist, but... Spare change, lady? Lousy cheapskate...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So hungry... can't leave car... Huh...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, uh, could you go across the street and get me a slice of pizza?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, shoot. All right, all right. Give me one bowl.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Geez! That's just... awful!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mmmm. Now, what do you have to wash that awful taste out of my mouth?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Blech! Eww! Geesh! I'll take a crab juice.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh. Uhh... You got a men's room in there?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But I can't leave my car until the parking guy gets here. Oh, why did I drink all that crab juice?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmmmm.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, boot guy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Flushing Meadows...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I can't take it anymore. All right, I'll only be gone for a second.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Frontsies... Backsies... I'm with them... V.I.P... Coming through... Very important person... They gave me frontsies...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"AAAAAAHHHHHHHHH. Oh, yes. Oh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What? ""Failure to wait by vehicle: $250.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh no, it's getting dark. Well, that's it. I'm getting out of this town alive if it kills me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's gonna be dark soon. I'll never make it out of here with this rotten boot on my car.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aha! I've got it! Brain, how can I ever thank you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just a minute... Everything's under control... Yes, I'd be upset, too...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey! Hey! Hey!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The boss says you're fired.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So long, Mr. Boot.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Come o-o-on! Come o-o-on!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Die! Die!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Homer one, New York nothing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thanks for your patience!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We're getting outta here, now! Jump in, Marge! Trust me! Throw the kids! No time for the baby!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Come on! Let's go! Everyone into the car! Now!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We'll see, honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We'll see.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, a fresh batch of America Balls! Mmm...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, lady, you obviously have at least one son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Or ""crapweeds"".",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not if they were called ""scumdrops"".",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fair enough.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, once more. Where are we going?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And why are you and the old lady in the car?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And why is Marge here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And why am I here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And why are the kids here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And why is Grampa here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Can I see your copy of ""Swank"", Armin?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, everybody, look! Armin Tamzarian's back and he's gonna take over the school again!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, all right. So, he's a fraud. I don't care! His mom doesn't care! Do any of you care?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, if you'll allow me, I think I have a solution that'll satisfy the town and let Sgt. Skinner keep his dignity.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And we salute you for it. Now don't come back.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh no we don't! Judge Snyder?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,BOY THE WAY THE BEE GEES PLAYED...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,GUESSING HOW MUCH ELVIS WEIGHED...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,WATCHING SHOWS LIKE GENTLE BEN...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"MISTER, WE COULD USE A MAN LIKE SHERIFF LOBO AGAIN.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,DISCO DUCK AND FLEETWOOD MAC...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey there, Meathead. What are you watchin'?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What a bad father.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, knock off that racket!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll practice you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, make her stop.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, Lisa, it doesn't look so bad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, honey, if it'll make you feel better I'll destroy something Bart loves.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, son. If that bothers you, I'll destroy something Maggie loves.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You don't remember how you got it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, well, it all happened in 1990. Back then, the artist formerly known as Prince was currently known as Prince. Tracey Ullman was entertaining America with songs, sketches, and crudely-drawn filler material. And Bart was eagerly awaiting his first day of school...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, son, on your first day of school, I'd like to pass along the words of advice my father gave me...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lousy traumatic childhood.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,BART WAS FEELING MIGHTY BLUE...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And that, my children, is the story of Bart's first day of school.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No problem. I'll just give her a sip of beer. Come on Maggie -- it's Miller time! Yes-it's-Mil-ler-time!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, my father gave me beer as a child. Till I wrapped my little red wagon around a tree.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And we never did.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Brilliant! I have absolutely no idea what's going on.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it's beautiful! Oh! Oh, let's put Bart's beautiful drawing up on the fridge!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, all right. What a- Burn it! Send it to Hell!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get it away!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, son. You wanna play catch?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"When a boy doesn't want to play catch with his old man, something is seriously wrong.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get the hell out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute... she's right!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, he's five. His life is over. Lisa's the wave of the future.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow. Just think of the possibilities.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hm.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, our little girl has a gift and we're willing to do what it takes to help her.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll give ya fifty bucks.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Seventy-five.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Excellente! Muchas gracias, SeÃ±orata!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ah so.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Our family was suffering through its worst crisis ever. Bart was miserable at school, and Lisa's gifts were going to waste.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You do that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dad, what are you doin' here?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ohhh. So hottt.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh-uh. Forget it Marge. There is no way I am spending my Saturdays at a Museum. Unless... Museums don't have foosball, do they?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You lose, Michelangelo's David. Who's next?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Unless what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge, but we've needed a new air conditioner for years! And our stopgap solution is getting cranky.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, name one successful person who ever lived without air conditioning.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No need for potty mouth just because you can't think of one.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Up up up up up up up. If ""ifs"" and ""buts"" were candy and nuts y... how does the rest of that go?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, all right, I promise. There must be another way to get an air conditioner...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmmm... re-circulated air.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What, Flanders.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I admit it looks bad, Flanders, but haven't you heard of ""Let he who is without sin cast the first stone?""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, Moe, this is it. Today's the day I get my new air conditioner.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,She has a gift.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oooh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wowww...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A musical instrument? Could that be a way to encourage a gifted child? Just give me a sign!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh, works for me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So what do you like, Lisa? Viomalin... tubamaba... obomoboe?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ohh! Saxomophone.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Two hundred dollars!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'll take it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah. ""To Lisa. Never forget your Daddy loves .""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,...and that inscription is still there today.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Next, I'll tell you the origin of Maggie's pacifier.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ohhhh, but Marge! Am I doomed to spend the rest of my life sweating like a pig?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Will you get off my front lawn?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why -- oh, I give up.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I learned from the master.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lisa! Enough saxomophone already!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid hippo.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid frog.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Relax, I built a bomb shelter.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fine, then don't use it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Good.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So do I.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You should be.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Blankets, radio... Oh, a Gary Larson calendar. I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. I--don't get it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You call that prime rib?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's green, moron. Earth to stupid guy, hullo? Maybe a little friendly punching will move your ass.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Heh, still got it...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Geez, what's with all the death?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my God. Everyone's gone! Little Bart...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Little Lisa-a-a...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Little Marge...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And the rest.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I've lost everything. I can't go on. No, no, no! I can't just wallow in sadness. It's time to laugh again. I'm the last man alive!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I can do everything I've always wanted!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Spade, why did you put Farley in charge of the bees? Hey buddy, down in front.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,War! Hunh! Good God y'all! / What is it good for? / Absolutely nothin'! Say it again! Okay!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what happened to the tunes?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what the hell's goin' on? Where'd you get those cloaks?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're mutants?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You want me? Come and get me!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A c... a coffin!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Die, you chalk-faced goons!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Go to hell, cloaky!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Safe at last.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That better not be the mutants.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge! Kids! You're alive!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ohh, com'ere.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now that's the Marge I married.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, who wants to steal some Ferraris?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, now let's not jump to conclusions, everyone.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,He's crazy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmmm, two bucks... And it only transports matter? Umm... Well, ah... I'll give you 35 cents.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I said I'll take it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This mountain of stairs used to make bedtime a grueling chore. But not any more, baby!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good night, losers!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man, how'd I live without this thing?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, man that's good.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, but this is a highly sophistimicated doowhackey. If you don't use it responsibly... Kablamo!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It was your mother.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, are you in there? Have you forgotten our little ""kablamo"" talk?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think she's right. The pants are a dead giveaway.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So then Lenny says, ""As if! Don't even go there, sister.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, well Lenny said it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh, it'll turn up somewhere.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay. It's your sugar, Bart.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Get 'im, boy! Smash that fly! Mush him up good!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nice work, son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nobody likes a tattletale, honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, we were lucky this time. But it's all too clear that some things in this universe aren't meant to be trifled with.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Something I should have done a long time ago.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll teach you to mess with my machine!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm gonna chop you good!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That cost me 35 cents!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're just making it worse. I promise I won't hurt you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That sounds like witch talk to me, Lisa.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! I accuse Goody Flanders.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,They're in my hair! They're in my hair!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, give us some candy. Don't pretend you're not home!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,She's a witch!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I've never heard of those people.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, yes, oh God yes!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'll kill myself if Portugal doesn't win.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bo-ring!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, but I want to do some rioting.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,All done.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'd like to buy your deadliest gun, please.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Relax, Marge. If someone tries to get in here, my burglar alarm will let us know.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Watch the fish, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What did I tell you, Marge?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, let's get that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let's get that! The suffocation thing!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Five hundred dollars! Forget it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I wouldn't have thought so either, but here we are.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I couldn't agree more, Marjorie. You deserve peace of mind and peace of mind is what you shall have.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't have to be careful, I got a gun.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Baby.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmm-hmm.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ahh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooo, I like the sound of that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I don't need anything like that - yet. Just gimme my gun.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Five days! But I'm mad now!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'd kill you if I had my gun.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lousy big shot. Thinks he's so big 'cause he's got a lot of guns.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, if he didn't have any guns, I'd show him a thing or two.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let's see what happens when he walks into my store. Then we'll see who's worried about five day waiting period...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge kicked me out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Pushy kids think they can tell me what to do in my house. I tell you parents these days, they don't know how to rear children.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How am I supposed to last five days without shooting something?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, come on, open up!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, I believe you have some sort of firearm for me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yuh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Former President.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Potentially dangerous?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Close your eyes Marge, I've got a surprise for you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay. Open your eyes!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, it's a handgun! Isn't it great? This is the trigger... and this is the thing you point at whatever you want to die...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I thought Smithers did it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Only if you clean your room.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,TV said that? But I have to have a gun. It's in the Constitution.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You couldn't be more wrong, Lisa. If I didn't have this gun, the King of England could just walk in here any time he wants and start shoving you around. Do you want that? Huh? Do you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, then.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A gun is not a weapon, Marge. It's a tool. Like a butcher knife or a harpoon or... a... a... an alligator. You just need more education on the subject. Tell you what: you come with me to an NRA meeting, and if you still don't think guns are great, we'll argue some more.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pull!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Learnin' somethin', Marge?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hi, I'm Homer S.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hi. It seems to me if a gun can protect something as important as a bar, it's good enough to protect my family. So if you'll have me, I would like to become a lifetime member of your wonderful organization!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, come on, be fair Marge. For once in your life, be fair.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What? Oh Apu, I would never...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Or would I?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll do it! I'll rob the Kwik-E-Mart.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, put your... Oh well, I'll rob it next time.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sure thing, honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You want me to get the cat down?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"See you in hell, dinner plate.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mmm, you probably left them at work. On another topic, guess who was picked to host the next NRA get-together?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You said the breakfast table.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen, if it'll make you feel any better, I'll put the safety on.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oops, guess it already was on.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh. I'd better just put it down.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, Marge. I'll do it. For you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I'm a wonderful man.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I see Bart gets to have a gun.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I put it in a safe place, Marge. I mean, what are the odds the boy would look in the vegetable crisper?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, I swear to you, I never thought you'd find out!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So this is the thanks I get for protecting my family? Then go! I'll be just fine!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooo, the gun club's gonna be here any minute!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They're here! They're here!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here's some more chocolate curls, gun buddies.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Anyone else want a beer?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I use it for everything! Watch me turn on the TV.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I didn't get one yet.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This gun cost me everything. My wife, my kids... everything but my precious, precious gun.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This stinks. I want my family back.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge? Sorry. Marge? Oh, sorry. Marge?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge, there's so many things I want to yell to you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,O-kay!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh-ho, confused, would we?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, honey, please come home. I need you. It's dark in the house and I'm hungry and lonesome. And there's no one there to hear my various witty remarks.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's gone for good, Marge. I finally realized, what's the point of having a gun for protection if you've got no one to protect?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Freeze, bad guy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know I said that, but what I secretly meant was...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The joke's on you, buddy. There's no bullets in that thing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, don't shoot!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm sorry I lied to you, Marge. But this gun had a hold on me. I felt this incredible surge of power, like God must feel when he's holding a gun. So please, get rid of it, because I know I'll just lie to you again and again!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now wait a second. You doctors have been telling us to drink eight glasses of gravy a day!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're a disgrace to this family.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There you go, Bart, Pee Wee Football will melt away those unsightly pounds and inches.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then it's settled.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Flanders. You're the worst coach this team has ever had.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, well... he's wearing that hat like an idiot.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fun, too.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ahh, you got lucky, Flanders! And fix that hat!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Huh, big deal. I've been carried out of Moe's like that hundreds of times.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm tellin' ya, Flanders can't coach at all! Now I'm not the type to have a grudge for no reason...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, Roy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes. Mr. Koufax, don't you think Flanders is a big jerk? Y'ello? Y'ello?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, Homer again. I think we got cut off. Y'ello?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Flaaaan-ders... Flaaaan-ders...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Flaaaan-ders...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Game's out there! Made you look...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know, Sweetie, and I got him right in the... uh-oh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hii-hi-hi-hi, hi, Flanders. Go Wildcats!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no. No, no, no. It's just that, well, like I was yelling earlier, it seems like anyone with half a brain could coach better than you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Me? But you were doing such a great job.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're not gonna make the team with that kinda attitude.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then why are you running the obstacle course?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You never use it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wipe that smile off your face.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm tired of watching you dog it on that football field. From now on, I'm gonna work you like a dog. Now go fetch me twenty laps.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, if you know a better way for me to live through my son, I'd like to hear it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I knew it. Slowing down already, huh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My father never believed in me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm not gonna make the same mistake. From now on I'm gonna be kinder to my son, and meaner to my Dad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Quit runnin', son. I just want to give ya a big hug!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I believe in you! Hug meeeee!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Will you hug meeeee? Hug meee!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good practice, team. Okay, it's time for the easiest part of any coach's job, the cuts.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now while I wasn't able to cut everyone I wanted to, I have cut a lot of you. Wendell is cut. Rudy is cut. Janey, you're gone. Steven, I like your hustle. That's why it was so hard to cut you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Congratulations, the rest of you made the team.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Except you, you and you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now just because I'm his father, he'll get no special treatment. He calls me ""Coach"" just like everyone else. Which he'll be doing... as our new starting quarterback!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What is it, sweetie?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not any more. From now on, you're my main man. Okay, now everyone give me five laps, and hit the showers. Oh, Rod, you don't have to. You're cut.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, you can do anything you want. I have total faith in you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Since your mother yelled at me. Now how 'bout that hug?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not so easy to keep your mouth shut now, is it, Flanders?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's okay, son. You'll do better next time.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look at him go!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Exx-cellent poise, son. You panicked, but you didn't lose your cool.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Great debut, son. You really settled in after some early jitters.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, really? Do reeky players get the game ball?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, everybody! Let's hear it for Bart!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, you guys are some k...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ohh, your Mother's not pregnant, is she?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ohh, boy. Well, I'll just have to go to my back up plan... Nelson, how's your arm feelin'?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good, take this note over to the referee.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, guys. We can't play without Bart. He's the heart of this team!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't listen to them, son. I have total faith in you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What? Well, I got news for you, Mister. You can't quit! You're cut! You too, Milhouse.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, so now you're quitting dinner, too.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I didn't raise him to be a quitter, Marge. It must have been you. You've quit every job you've ever had: cop, pretzel vendor, church counselor, professional gambler...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, if quitting is the best, maybe I should just quit my job.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Burns, this is Homer J. Simpson, the father of the big quitter. Well, I just wanted to tell you I'm a big quitter, too, and I quit!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We're in the championship. Way to go, team!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, Bart, looks like it's just you and... Ohhh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm feelin' kinda low, Apu. You got any of that beer that has candy floatin' in it? You know, ""Skittlebrau""?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh. Well, then, just give me a six-pack and a couple bags of Skittles.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I wanna apologize. I just got so caught up trying to encourage you, I was blinded to your stinky performance. If you forgive me, I promise I'll never encourage you again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've got lots of quarters.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aww... You know, tomorrow's the championship game and I could sure use a good offensive tackle.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Consider him cut.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hold on, I'm workin' it out.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay. Half of you vibrate that way, two of you fall down, Nelson, you just spin around in a circle.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh no, my quarterback. What are we gonna do?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Are you sure, son?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I knew I could count on you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Scully, you're cut. Ehhh, Brooks, Groening, Simon, you're all cut. Castellaneta, gone. Kavner, cut. Cartwright, cut. Smith, sorry, cut. Azaria and Shearer, you're cut. Firestone, you're cut. So is Judge. Namath, you stay. All of those people are cut. Phil, Schultz and Wolf and Silverman. Goldreyer, O'Brien, Dolye, Selman. I don't know what... I don't know what you're doin' here, 'cause you're all cut. Pietila, Clan..., Kuwahaha... There're so many cuts here look, I'll just post 'em up and you just see where your name is. Oooo, look at how many cuts there are there. Ohhh, boy, you're cut. All of you. He's cut, I cut you! You're cut too, Shooshie!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, why don't we buy 'em mink stoles while we're at it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I understand. Yoink. Wow...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whoa...,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Ooo, let's see what she wrote!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you hate lotus flowers, too? Oh, don't get me started on Lotus flowers.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh. Well, congratulations.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not... really...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"O-kay, here we go...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Tell her the truth. You're not ready to get married.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then just tell her you're already married.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then get married. What the hell do you want from me?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Loser. Loser. Loser. Five... hundred.... dollars! Apu wake up! I want to buy a Yodel and this lottery ticket.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I have this much.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh... Oh... Ooo... Oh... Yodel.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Late night, huh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You dog.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's the big problem?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then maybe you shouldn't of told her you did.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay... seems to me , what you oughta do is, um...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wellll, you could always move into my house, and tell your mom that Marge is your wife.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that Yodel was so good. I wish I was eatin' it right now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, crap, I forgot!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I need a small favor. For the next few days, will you pretend to be Apu's wife?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Please? It's just for as long as his mother's living here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can you feel the love?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, gotta run. Apu, I'm sure you wanna to get upstairs and fix that broken toilet before Marge yells at you again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But you can't leave! We're scammin' an old lady at my house and I need a place to hide out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, right. With the giant heads.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Dad. I've come to spend some time with my favorite father.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Oh, no you don't.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Eat my dust!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Damn right.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmm. Who knew that Lay's made liquid potato chips? I can't suck just one.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Please. Also, I think I'm getting a bedsore. What do you have to do to get turned around here?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's Lucky hooked up to?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker! And how come everyone gets a bedpan and I have to walk all the way over there?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"When I get old, Marge, I want you to promise you'll put me in a home. It's like being a baby, only you're old enough to appreciate it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ohhh, right, right. The fake marriage thing. How's that goin'?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lied to his mother.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know what you could do, Apu...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You could fake your own death...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All you need is a car bomb and...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe, what do you recommend for severe depression?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Actually, it's more like twelve. No, I'm so stupid, seven. It's seven hours. You have seven hours. See? Seven.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,C'mon. You shouldn't be spending your last hours of bachelorhood in a dump like this.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You should be livin' like there's no tomorrow. And I know just the place.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ahh. Is this the life, or what?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nah, just your screwy country.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, Apu. Some day you'll meet someone you really love.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Gods, eh?",,,,,

Homer Simpson,That doesn't matter. The important thing is we won.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sheesh! You're the most paranoid family I've ever been affiliated with.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'd like a yellow boat, please. With extra motors.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Howdy, gents! I'm here to collect my free--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,OW! OW! My boating arm! What's going on?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lousy cops. Lucky for you I'm double-parked or I'd... There. Now, can I please have my motorboat?",,,,,

Homer Simpson,HEEERE'S THE ANGEL! / SEEEE THE ANGEL / IT'S MY ANGEL / NO ONE ELSE'S / NEXT TO-OO TH-E RAKES!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No one's calling it an angel, Lisa. If you'll look carefully, you'll notice I never once used the word ""angel"".",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's a typo.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no. Oh, no. We could lose out on bags and bags of money. It's sacrilegious, I tell ya.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pfft! Facts are meaningless. You can use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true. Facts shmacts.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, folks. Get your angel glow sticks! No one gets into heaven without a glow stick!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Somebody stop her!,,,,,

Homer Simpson,Then what are you complaining about? You got yours. Mm-hm-hm.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah. You've gotta be careful when you do a trick like this....",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Man, the air feels good on my neck!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooo, gumball.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,Stupid heater! Don't make me come in there!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know me, Marge. I crave the hustle and bustle.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Santa's got a little trick up his sleeve.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Attention, shoppers. Register 9 is now open for your shopping convenience.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, these are for display only... This has been recalled... Oo, Bart would like this... We're out of these...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Register 9 is now closed.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, kids. Let's try the lights!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Knock it off...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What the-- Where's Christmas? Lisa, where's Christmas?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can - we - skip - church?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, there's no easy way to say it, kids: God hates us.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, but they'll have to be pretty damn miserable to make me happy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah? We'll show 'em. Come on, kids, pretend we've got new cross-country skis.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's not as fun as it looks.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, you promised they'd be miserable. What the hell's goin' on?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, you're right, Moe. You're always Moe.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You take that back, Barney!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stay out of this, old man.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, that's my girl. I love you, Marjorie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You shut up.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Wow, this really restores your faith in...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, do you have to practice that stupid song now?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, Ted.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, kids, let's go buy some happiness!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Is this car $15,000?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What a deal! I'd be a sucker not to get it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Outta my way, snow-poke!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, honey. I know exactly what I'm --",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oopsie.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shut up! One at a time! Lisa?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I knew this would happen.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, no! Your hands are too weak!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm gonna kill you! / No, I'm killing him first! / Why you little... Bart, the next time you ever have... / You went too far...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, Kent. ""Hello, jerk. We may never find you, and we should probably all stop looking. But one thing's for sure: you do exist.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it's true! We weren't robbed! That part we made up! But the rest is true!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, the boy told us. But that was after we filed a phony police report.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Relax, Marge. This'll all blow over.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no. Look at the line!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Head of the line! A family could get used to being shunned. Huh? Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Run for your lives, everyone! This is not a drill!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh great, now we have to send him a card.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,There's only one way out. We've gotta give this greedy town its money back.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh no, there's that angry mob again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the hell's goin' on?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maybe so. But there's one thing they forgot to take away from us. This washcloth.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The hell it is!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Gimme that! / Uh, gimme that! / No! / Let go! / Gimme that my washcloth! / I want it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, she's getting away with the washcloth!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Go!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I got it! Oh, it's just a thread! It was... She's got... she's got the washcloth!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, they put us on the ""Waiting to Exhale Waiting List."" But they said don't hold your breath.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whoa. Whoa. Calm down, little lady--Take it easy--Take it easy. No.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Something very close, exactly along those lines--A Clint Eastwood - Lee Marvin shoot 'em up western!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"With blood, I bet!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"They're singing! They're singing, Marge! Why aren't they killing each other?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait, wait, wait. Here comes Lee Marvin. Thank God. He's always drunk and violent.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, why did they have to screw up a perfectly serviceable wagon story with all that fruity singing?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Singing is the lowest form of communication.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No I don't, I hate to rhyme.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"NO I DON'T, I THINK THEY'RE BAD / THEY'RE FAKE AND PHONEY AND TOTALLY WRONG.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I WOULDN'T / I COULDN'T / I HATE THAT STUFF!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,AND THEIR DAMP-TROUSERED PA.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"SEE? ALL THIS SINGING SCARED HIM AWAY / IF WE JUST TALKED LIKE NORMAL, HE'D PROBABLY STAY.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I knew I should've shut that window.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Not spy, squeal. I've got no choice.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Quiet, honey, you don't know how big this government is. It goes all the way to the president.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Does this make me look fat?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But not fat.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So if my cover gets blown and I need help, what's the signal?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I see you're watchin' the ball game. Looks like a good one. Any of you involved in any illegal activity? Cause I could sure go for some.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"How 'bout you, Lenny? Testing, testing? Lenny?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maybe. But first I need to hear about some other crimes to get me fired up.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uhhhh, like those. But involving you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Barney? That was me! And I'd do it again.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that's ridiculous, Moe. End transmission.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm just glad it's all over.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why do you keep picking on me? Marge's name was on that tax return, too.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Walk? That wasn't part of the deal.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Losers...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ooh! A trillion-dollar bill? 'Atsa spicy meatball!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But Mr. Burns gave me my job. And he hasn't fired me, even after three meltdowns and one China Syndrome. I can't betray him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm in.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, I'm Homer Simpson, your trusted employee.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uhh, I don't know what to tell you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, Mr. Burns, you always come off as kind of a gruff, crotchety loner, but we both know that deep down inside...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Still cold.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Starting search for trillion-dollar bill.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon... Where are you?... Here, Trilly, Trilly.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uhmmmm... Errr... Uhhhhh...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, yeah, sure. That thing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No you don't. Heh, heh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ewww!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is that a fish?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, that guy looks like you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is that the trillion-dollar bill in his hand?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wowww, that must be worth a fortune.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, he's right...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm gonna write the best darn article... Oh wait.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Take that, Uncle Sam!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We'll hide out at my place. I've got beer.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ohh, we're never gonna make it. Let's just divide up the trillion now, and go our separate ways.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I can't leave the country! What about my wife and kids?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We'd better do what he says.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! We can gamble!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I call President!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you're gonna love it in Cuba, Marge. There's shredded pork everywhere.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nice to meet you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I had no idea.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Burns, I think we can trust the President of Cuba.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's hard to believe there's a place worse than America, but we found it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,God bless America!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, the gum with the cracker center. Mmm.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That'll do it, Apu. So just--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Helper monkey, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'd like a monkey, please. And maybe one of those dogs. What do they do?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do they do any other tricks?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just the monkey then.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh-ho-ho, I'm not handicapped. I'm just lazy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Enfeebled?! Oo, I know just the guy! Be right back.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mind if I take him for a ride?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There a problem, honey?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Relax. It's only Mojo. Mojo, Marge. Marge, Mojo. He can do anything you show him. Watch.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Simpson residence.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This ""filthy monkey"" made the orange juice you're drinking.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge! The kids are on!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Honey, he's clearly marked his territory.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, can I get a duck?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can he get a duck?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Come on. Come to Poppa.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good boy, Mojo. Now, bring 'em down and I'll give you one.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Would you... Stop that! You're a helper monkey. This isn't helping!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I don't need your pity.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And so on.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mojo, will you wipe my mouth?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What do you want? His cholesterol's through the roof.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no. He's fine. Go on, Mojo, show Marge your happy dance.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, don't you ruin another Love Day.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They didn't have Lord Huggington?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I guess.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Kiss it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh-ho yeahhh...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, but the memories will last a lifetime.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Crap -- py -- stuff.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nuh-uh. It isn't filled until it's spilled.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, but I can rebuild!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ow-ow, stupid-trash, rotten-stinky, hate-world, revenge-soon, take out on everyone... Garbage water! Oh-ho-ho!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're pushin' me, baby.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey wait! Stop! I have garbage!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You guys are the lousiest garbage men ever! Yeah, I'm talkin' to you! You trash-eatin' stink bags!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know. A lot of people were yelling stuff.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That was yesterday, moron!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good news, everyone. I got in a fight with the garbage men and they're cutting off our service.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I'd rather live in a dump than in a world run by snooty garbage men.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I never apologize, Lisa. I'm sorry, but that's just the way I am.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Siddown, honey. The men will clear the table!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So long, chicken bone.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No room for you, Jell-O.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry Ned. I didn't see you down there. Got him.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then you might wanna close your windows before the sun hits Diaper Hill.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So-ho, the rats seem happy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's not the way she tells it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, it's like the measles. Good to get it out of the way.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but I'm always secretly disappointed when you do. Anyway, I think those garbage men are starting to crack.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Apologize for that remark.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Attaboy!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good morning, Trash Pile. How's about...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey! Woo-hoo! I won!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This is a very, very proud day for us, especially me. Your father, me, beat City Hall. It's just like David and Goliath, only this time David won.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And to think you wanted me to crawl, Marge! Well, this man doesn't crawl. He stands tall. That rhymes, Marge, and you know it rhymes. Admit it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You signed my name? I feel so violated.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But this isn't like a loan application or a will -- you signed away my dignity. And I'm going to get it back. Lisa, do I have my pants on?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Perfect.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't come off all high and mighty with me, Patterson. You can't scare me, with your office and your desk and your lamp.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, oh, oh, I get it. Put on a big show for the cameras.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I came to fight City Hall. I wanna shake things up, Patterson. Stir up some controversy. Rattle a few cages.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You'll never silence me! I'm the last angry man, Patterson! A crusader for the little guy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Never!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You want to know what I think?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, we'll see about that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I want to register to run for Sanitation Commissioner. And tell the fatcats upstairs -- things are gonna change in this town!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why you little... No one's gonna beat ya, son. You're gonna get such a beating.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, vote Simpson... Hi... Nice to see ya... Heh, thanks for comin' out... Keep puttin' on weight, huh? Lenny, my man.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What am I, the answer man? Just vote for me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,These old geezers just don't get it. It's time to rock the vote.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Potato man.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Take a hike, Kojak.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hellooo Springfield! It's me, Homer!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Quiet, you! I know you youngsters wanna see these rockin' rockers. But I also know you care about the race for Sanitation Commissioner. So, let me give ya the 911...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's a good question, Bono. 'Cause I'd be the most wack, tripped-out Sanitation Commissioner ever! Can ya dig it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ow! Oh, Bono! Help me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"My campaign is a disaster, Moe.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I hate the public so much. If only they'd elect me... I'd make 'em pay. Oh Moe, how do I make 'em like me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can't someone else do it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It is?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can't someone else do it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fellow citizens! How would you rate the trash service in this town?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, okay, it's excellent. But aren't you tired of waking up early and dragging the garbage to the curb?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Aren't you tired of having to peel that last snotty Kleenex from the bottom of your wastebasket?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well then...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well then, can't someone else do it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And can't someone else scoop out that nasty kitty litter?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, Ray Patterson thinks you should do it! Animals are crapping in our houses, and we're picking it up. Did we lose a war? That's not America. That's not even Mexico.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't you deserve better than the best?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who should handle all your dirty jobs?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm sorry my opponent didn't think enough of you to show up for this debate. I'm sure he had more important things to do.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, then you shoulda been early.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not if we hire more men. And my men will do all your messy jobs. They'll wash your car, scrub your shower, air out your stinkables...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, then you'd better turn up your hearing aid, Pops.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do we want old man Patterson here with his finger on the button?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What-what-what. What button? Where am I? Who took my false teeth?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fifty cents? Not likely.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Ray. Cleanin' out the old office, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa Ray. Are we gonna let politics get in the way of our friendship?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, that was just a lie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"See? We're still friends. C'mon, give us a cuddle.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Jean-Paul, how are the new uniforms? Do they match the suede boots? Beautiful. Did you get the new trucks? Are they amphibious? Well, there's only one way to find out. We can always buy more.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, I gotta work hard, honey. Daddy made a lot of crazy promises.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, the garbage man can, Marge. The garbage man can.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,WHO CAN TAKE YOUR TRASH OUT? / STOMP IT DOWN FOR YOU? / SHAKE THE PLASTIC BAG AND DO THE TWISTY-THINGY TOO? / THE GARBAGE MAN...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh no! Wait, I think I've got the perfect solution.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Patterson was right. I'm crashing and burning... crashing and burning...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"They let me sign checks with a stamp, Marge. A stamp!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait, shutup... I just thought of something!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"'Mornin', boys.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Will cash be okay?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, before I show ya, who wants to guess how I got the money?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Close, but you're way off.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look at that beautiful garbage! Other cities don't want it, so they pay me to dump it in this old abandoned mine.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge... ix-nay on the ash-hole-tray.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sure I can, Honey-kitten.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, nothin'.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, uh, you were saying how great I was...?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nay!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Come to what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, it's somethin', all right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but whaddaya gonna do? If you need me, I'll be at Moe's.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hi Moe.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but can he do this?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What? They had a picnic last week.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If God didn't want us to eat in church, he would have made gluttony a sin.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooo, still plenty of parking.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, out of the way, whoever you are. You're blocking the food.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, son, Daddy's down for the day. Why don't you go capture me some more potato salad?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Flanders is playing? Why didn't you say so?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I agree. Let's surrender.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmm... All right, but don't lose them. They're my only pair.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid kids...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Time out... t... time out...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, stop it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've never seen Bart so ashamed of me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge. How could you let me let myself go like this?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, well, I've humiliated my son for the last time. I'm going to get into shape.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I mean it. I'm really serious this time.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, boy, I want you to keep this exercise thing under your hat. That way I won't be embarrassed if I fail.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, great. Now the cat knows.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, here we go...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, son. Daddy got in shape. E--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I've got to keep trying! Or I could just move that picture. No! The picture looked good where it was. Boy, drag me back outside.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uhh... Don't you have anything healthy here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, these Power Sauce bars look pretty healthy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmm... A bushel of apples packed in each bar, plus a secret ingredient that unleashes the awesome power of apples. Wow.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Gym? What's a ""Gym?""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ohhh... a gym.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ow! Ow! Ow! Boy, am I feeling this. Ow! Oh, my head's gonna be sore in the morning. Ow!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ranier Wolfcastle! Oh, I love your movies and your Power Sauce bars and your taut, rippling--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, Wolfie. Two months ago I didn't know what the word ""dumbbell"" meant. This place is great.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, handsome. Nice muscles. Care for a rubdown? Oh-ho, well, I'm flattered, but spoken for. Oh, what the heck, give me your number.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I have been working out secretly at night. And look at me now!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Heh, heh, heh. Go ahead. Try and grab some flab. Go on. Ju--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, not there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not there either. Over here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, here. Try my foot. No, not that foot. Just feel my biceps.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, whaddaya think of your old man now, son?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Damn right.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How can you put that filth into your bodies?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look at you people. Bart's a tub, Lisa's weak as a little girl, and Maggie doesn't seem to be growing at all.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You too, Marge. If you toned up a little, you'd probably get a lot more action.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, I only eat food in bar form. When you concentrate food, you unleash its awesome power, I'm told. That's why I'm compressing five pounds of spaghetti into one handy mouth-sized bar.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hm.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hospital, please.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, he helped me blast through the burn and ride the zone.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Overshoot the extreme, max the envelope, and so on.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I am?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, mountain-climbing supplies: rope, ice axe, heart medicine...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You? Did?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If you're trying to scare me, it won't work. I'm one hundred percent focused on my goal. Hey, my hat has ear flaps!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?... Wha ya?... Hey! You guys are dragging me up the mountain.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's right, Brad and Neil. I only eat Power Sauce -- the bar with Apple-saucicity.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aww. Goodbye, everyone. Don't touch my stuff.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, yeah...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, man, this is hard.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, this climb is the most difficult ordeal I have ever faced.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow! Look how far I climbed! And I'm not even tired!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wake up, you lazy Sherpas. We've got a mountain to climb!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So nobody believes I can do this, huh? Well, my son does. And I'm not gonna let him down. I'm going to climb this entire mountain on my own.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shut up. You are so fired.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Homer Simpson here. I've sent the Sherpas home and I'm heading for the top, solo.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The hell I won't. You're forgetting I've got my Power Sauce bars.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Deng Xiao-Ping died.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Forget it. I'll be at the top by noon. Over and out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Air's getting thin, but I'm gonna make it. Woo! Getting lightheaded... Good -- no heavy head to carry. Wait! I'll just take that escalator!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,La la la la la la la la...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,La la la la la la la la la...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just a few feet more...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I did it! I made it all the way to... Aw, crap!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It just keeps going! I give up. You beat me, mountain!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,At least I won't freeze to death.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Last entry. I have mountaineered to the utmost, but the peak is unclimbable. Worse still, that treacherous skunk Abe Simpson stole my oxygen, and tried to eat my left arm.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ew, Dad. ""Tell my beloved wife my last thoughts were of her, blinding and torturing Abe Simpson. Cheerio.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"My Dad's a disgrace, just like Bart's Dad. Me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This may not be the top, but it's as close as a Simpson's ever gonna get.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This is for you, son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey. Wait a minute. I'm on the top. I actually did it. I climbed the unclimbable mountain! Bow down before me, everyone! For I am your KING!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hi.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge, I never thought you'd see me again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why don't you tell me, son? See any interesting flags up there?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, dammit!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, Bart. That makes it all worthwhile.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"'Mornin', Barney.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Huh? Whuh? Hyuwhuh? I'm awake! I'm awake! I'm a productive member of the team! You can't fire me, I quit! Please, I have a family! Well, let's see what we got in the ol' drawer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Eh. Eh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Aha. There's some glue.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hope this stuff holds.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hello?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who is this?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Museum? I don't like the sound of that. What did your mother say?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmm. So you want to take the bus, huh? I don't know. That's a pretty big decision...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Two hundred dollars?! Isn't there any other way?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Frankly, I do. I know you had your heart set on a limo, but sometimes daddies have to say no, honey. I'm afraid you're gonna have to take the bus.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Atta girl. I love you, sweet --",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"My daughter's at that Egyptian dealy right now. She wanted to take a limo, but I made her take the bus.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"MMMaybe... but you don't know Lisa. I mean she's so smart, they hooked her up to a big computer to try to teach it some things, but she had so much knowledge it overloaded and then it got really hot and caught on fire.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, yesss... but now I have to leave on a totally unrelated matter.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lisa!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lisa?! Lisa?! Li-sa?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, where is she?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Has anyone seen my little girl?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"For God's sakes, my little girl is--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hello.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I am at work. This is what I do.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Keep it moving, Marge. This isn't a parking lot.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, yes sir, Mr. Burns, sir.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Excuse me, ma'am, have you seen this girl?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lisa... Lisa...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is no good. I've got to get up higher.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Give me all your balloons.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I hope this works...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,These are for you if you let me use your cherry picker.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lisa? Lisa? Lisa!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stay there! I'll come down and save you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lisa! Save me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no! I'm gonna go off the end of the --",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm not normally a praying man, but if you're up there, please save me, Superman.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Lisa, thank God you're okay!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow! Ow! Ow! Oww!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nah, I'll just walk it off.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't ever say that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If I hadn'ta taken a stupid risk with that cherry picker, I never would have found you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stupid risks are what make life worth living. Now your mother, she's the steady type, and that's fine in small doses. But me, I'm a risk taker. And that's why I have so many adventures.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Feel your heart pumping a mile a minute? That's what my heart's doing all the time. Bet your left arm's tingling too, huh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm enjoying my life too much to care. And you should be too. So what would you like to do right now, more than anything in the world?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Closed, eh? So getting in would be a pretty big risk. What do you say, honey? Feeling stupid? I know I am.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just a little higher...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Good. You're gonna need that adrenaline to make the final jump.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Could you open the window? The cops have Daddy's prints on file.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... not this exquisite.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, Daddy will figure it out.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, you can't go this far and then not go further.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, so now it's we, eh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Anytime, honey. Just remember, never be afraid to live life on the edge. Now let's get home before your mother kills us.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah... but it'll always live on, because we'll never forget it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It is? Well... that's a good song too. Do do do do-do do do...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Run!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, honey, I clipped on my tie all by myself.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Happy Anniversary, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, look what was in here. A program from that guy's funeral.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, him. Whatever happened to that guy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, the Gilded Truffle is an intimate, elegant place.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You mean there's been cake in our freezer for eleven years? Why was I not informed?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Marge, wouldn't it be weird if they had little parties at night? Wee little parties?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gotcha!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Another super year with a super lady. Good night, honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, um, it is a special occasion...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah. Seems like the thing to do.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, you gonna...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh. No. No, I'm the guy. I'm supposed to, uh...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know, but let me get you started first.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right. How's that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, sorry.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no. Don't do that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know, but I don't like it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ahh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look who's here!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He's the best boy!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Marge, wasn't that great when the dog came in here?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I love that dog.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,G'night.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmm, that's queer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The food!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why did this happen? Whyyyyyy?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It was just the shock of seeing all that food on the floor. Plus I'd just fallen on my back, which hurt more than I let on.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh, I never thought I'd live this long.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll get us out of this, honey. It's just gonna take a whole lot of floorin'.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmmm...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"When you think about it, mud is nothing but wet dirt.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shhh. We're trespassing. And some of these farmers have pitchforks.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That was close!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"At your service, milady.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cara mia...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, I told you not to leave that TV on.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no, honey. Maybe this will help.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, guys. Marge and I are spending the weekend at a bed and breakfast.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nah, it'd just be awkward... what with the sex and all.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now they did say bed and breakfast, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If there's anything more exquisite than Queen Anne's lace, I haven't found it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you ready to rock? 'Cause heeere we go!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um, no time like the present.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, yeah, kinda...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Did that butter churn just move? 'Cause if it did...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mine too. Just like back in that hay loft.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There's the dirty girl I married. Come on, I have a disgusting idea.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They didn't hear us in the sewing room.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, everybody.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart! Yes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Awww... Eskimo kiss!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't think anything I've ever done is wrong.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not yet. Wait... wait... wait... now!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It hasn't changed since that magical evening when I knocked you up.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, I thought Bart would be born a dimwit.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, this time I'm drunk on love... and beer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, why can't they just play through?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ohh, why are people always trying to kill me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, can we trade? I don't trust these guys.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Y'know, all this danger is kind of a turn--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gil! Thank God it's you. You gotta help us.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Honey, my shoulders are separating.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, we're surrounded, Marge. Maybe we should give ourselves up.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, the British tabloids will have a field day. There's only one thing left to do.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Grab onto the handles, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, I think I've figured this thing out. It can go up and down, but not side to side, or back in time.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,These have pleats...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm okay, honey. Now listen very carefully. I want you to pull on the thing that's near the other thing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, that was not the thing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thank you...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, uh, can we not land here?... Honey?... Baby doll...?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why don't you take a picture? It lasts longer.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dads especially!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Scary ways. But we never intended it to end like that. With thousands of people staring at our naked bodies.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who's in the mood for miniature golf?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can't you just write on your arm like I do?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yo, Apu, gimme the usual.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, this hot dog tastes different.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, yeah, but without the grease all you can taste is the hog anus.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,People buy grease?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Used grease is worth money? Then my arteries are clogged with yellow gold. I'm rich, Apu! Rich, I--!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Money in the bank.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, this bacon's done.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And now for the profit taking.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Looks like he's about ready for another squeezin'.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, if you don't mind, I'm a little busy right now achieving financial independence.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, through savings and wise investments. Of course with grease!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where do you think you're goin'?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not for you it isn't. You're in the grease business now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, boy, this is where all the hard work, sacrifice, and painful scaldings pay off.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but your Mom paid for that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I get my money from grease. What's the problem?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, look at that load of grease. Boy, if we're ever gonna earn paper money, we have to expand our operation.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you'll miss plenty. I have a feeling this business is going to consume our whole lives.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Li-sa, I can't imagine anyone being more likable than you. But apparently this new girl is. So my advice would be to start copying her in every way.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh-uh, think. Is that what Alex would say?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh I'll say. Look at that redheaded kid. There must be twenty dollars' worth of grease on his forehead alone.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right. We'll try it your way.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"My God, you're greasy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If she didn't want her car ruined, she should've done a better job hiding her keys.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what the...?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, hey, you're taking our grease!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, that's my shovel.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I can't believe those goons muscled me out of my grease business. I've been muscled out of everything I've ever done, including my muscle-for-hire business.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, what's the point?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Emus? Really? Oh, that's pretty crazy... Nah... I'd only fail just like I fail at everything.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute. The boy's right! I can't quit now. Aww, you always know just what to say to cheer me up. Emu farm... You're priceless, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, son, we're about to embark on our most difficult mission. Let's bow our heads in prayer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dear Lord, I know you're busy, seeing as how you can watch women changing clothes and all that. But if you help us steal this grease tonight, I promise we'll donate half the profits to charity.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, screw it. Let's roll.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmm... I knew I should have attached those somehow.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This better work, boy. I don't wanna wind up workin' on your mother's emu farm.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, turn on the suction.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's not working.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What is it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bringin' up the rear.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, here goes...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And now we wait. So... is this your school?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uhhhh... we're, uh, new foreign exchange students from, uh... um... Scotland.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uhh... North... Kilt... town?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute, there's no Angus MacCloud in North Kilt-town. Why you're not from Scotland at all!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow! Stop pummeling me! It's really painful!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, please. The groundskeeper and I are trying to settle this like adults.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's my grease! It's mine! Give it here!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Website.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Seventy-six point two?! But I'm already thirty-eight point one! I've wasted half my life!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Half my life gone! And I'm only guaranteed thirty-eight more years.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge! I've wasted half my life.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What are you talking about, Marge? I don't need a...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, send the truck.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I don't deserve sugar. I'm halfway to my grave, and I haven't accomplished anything. Oh, I am not looking forward to my funeral.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, no matter what happens in the future, promise me you won't vote for Lenny.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah, they'll put me on a stamp for that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I've wasted half my life, Marge. Do you know how many memories I have? Three! Standing in line for a movie, having a key made, and sitting here talking to you. Thirty-eight years and that's all I have to show for it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cold.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh. I see you're having a party. I'll come back later.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, all right. Maybe I can pinpoint where my life went wrong.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,All we did was grow some space tomatoes and sabotage Mir.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hike.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I shoulda punted. Turn it off! Turn it off!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stupid movies. Who invented these dumb things anyway? Was it you, Bart?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No one man can do all that. You're a liar, honey. A dirty, rotten liar.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Really? A restaurant? Well, now I don't know what to think.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Cut it out, boy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Reading about this Edison character. They won't let me in the big people library downtown. There was some unpleasantness. I can never go back.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, look at all the inventions Edison came up with. The stock ticker, the storage battery, even wax paper. And look at him dance.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,De de de de de.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And these Hardy Boys books are great, too. This one is about smugglers.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, not this one. ""The Smugglers of Pirate Cove."" It's about pirates.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think it's pretty obvious that I am.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Go school!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not the way I quit. Ooh-who.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, great story, Lenny. But here's one that's even more spellbinding. Once upon a time there was a man named Thomas Edison. And he invented the dictating machine and the fluoroscope and the repeating telegraph...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"... And he was a firm believer in Fletcherism, and he played the organ, and his favorite flower was the heliotrope -- oh, and his middle name was Alva. And he never, ever, ever wore pajamas. And...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I remember where Edison worked. It was Menlo Park. That's where he came up with the tasimeter, the ore separator and...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's boring. You're boring everybody. Quit boring everyone!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,... And then he worked on a machine to communicate with the dead. Some kind of scary telephone I guess. Or maybe he planned to just stick his head under the ground and yell.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ohh, that's where you're wrong, Marge. He was a shameless self-promoter.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, that's it! That's why I haven't done anything with my life! I need to be more like Thomas Edison!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I'm starting right now. No more lousy pajamas!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"From this day forward, I am an inventor!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I quit my job just like you said to.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, you did. I remember your exact words. You said I should quit my job and become an inventor or you'd torch the house.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"At my age Edison had already invented 203 things. Ohh, I've got a lot of work to do to catch up to him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let's see now... inventions... inventions...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What? Eh. Eh. Let me handle the creative end of this, Marge. You don't understand how the creative mind works like I do.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You look at this table and what do you see? Just a table. Now, a creative person, like me, looks at this table and sees all kinds of creative things -- but no tables.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My files!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, this isn't working. I've got to try a different approach.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes. Thomas Edison smoked several cigars a day.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shutup.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"As long as you're here annoying me, let's have a brainstorming session. Now, here's how it works: Lisa, you say one thing, then Bart, you say another. Just toss out things and I'll use my inventive mind to combine them into a brilliant original idea.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-huh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A-- Wait a minute! These aren't exciting new products! You're not even trying. Okay, that's it. Both of you go to your rooms and spank yourselves.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't see why not. They're my kids. I own 'em.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, we own 'em.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ohhh, it's no use. I can't work like this, cut off from the scientific community.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You stay here and guard the sandwich.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, I just want to know how to invent things. Tell me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You mean like an electric blanketmobile?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hamburger earmuffs!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, sucker!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, I have here the four greatest inventions in the history of mankind.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"First, my All-Purpose Electric Hammer. ""For all your pounding needs.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Probably needs to be more powerful.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, here's my ""Everything's Okay"" Alarm.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This will sound every three seconds unless something isn't okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It can't be turned off.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But it does break easily. Now this next one's for the ladies. How many times have you gals been late for a high-powered business meeting, only to realize you're not wearing makeup?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's why I invented this revolutionary makeup gun. It's for the woman who only has four-fifths of a second to get ready. Close your eyes, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And now you're ready for a night on the town.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh. Oh. Okay, this time try to keep your nostrils closed.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, look what you did. Now I have to get my cold cream gun.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Women will like what I tell them to like. Now here's something for everyone.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"In the olden times, if you were watching TV and nature called, you'd have to get up and walk to the bathroom. It was the hardest thing in the world to do. But now, with the Lazy Man Reclining Toilet Chair, you can just lean back and let 'er rip.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sure! Believe me, every man in America will want to have one.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes? Yes? Yes?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But this is the best I could do. I guess I'm no better at being Thomas Edison than I was at being Homer Simpson.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All week, my life long dream was to be the next Thomas Edison, but now it's over. I guess I'll just give up my hopes and dreams and settle for being a decent husband and father.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that. I stuck a couple of extra legs on there 'cause I kept tipping over when I was trying to invent stuff.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really? You think it's a good idea?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I did it! I'm gonna be rich!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, Mr. Edison, I did it. I'm an inventor! And I owe it all to you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"See? It's just a regular chair, but I attached a couple of extra legs to the back... kinda like the ones on the back of your...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,AWDAMMIT!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I thought I had a great idea, but I must've seen it on this poster.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's not? Maybe he never told anyone about it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That chair might be the only one he made.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, we've got to go to the Edison Museum and smash it! Then I'll be an inventor!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, to hell with him!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Taking-Bart-across-state-lines-Back-soon.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I borrowed your wallet!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, son, you're young and headstrong, just like Thomas Edison, Jr. You know, he started a mushroom farm, and an auto parts company, and he sold his good name to a quack medicine company. Oh, and later, he raised turkeys. That was on his turkey farm.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now let's take care of business.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Outta the way. This is one invention you're not getting credit for, you inspiration hog!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Invent your way out of this, Edison.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, son. Edison was just like me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No! We both lived in another man's shadow. This old-timey nerd and I have suffered the same frustration and heartache.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We're not rivals. We're just a couple of dreamers who set the bar a little too high. I can't destroy your work, my friend.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, but we'll stop off at the da Vinci Museum on the way home...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh. Well then, we'll take it out on Eli Whitney.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yay! / All right! / Woo-hoo! /,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's my Tommy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let's just say I'm sitting in the right chair.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mail call! Gather 'round, everyone!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right. One for ""resident""...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, that's it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I needed my power fix.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, quit stalling, Marge. We want our reward.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man, it feels good to get out of that car. Ooo, go-carts! C'mon everybody, let's go.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look at me, Bart! I'm driving!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stand back and watch the pro.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nah. They mess up my hair.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ooh. Ball one.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ball two. This Bozo's gonna walk me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're going down, you--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh! Oh! Why you-- Hey you-- You better-- I'm gonna-- If you k--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I rolled up all the socks.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's next?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I hate folding sheets.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, whatever it is, it's a two-man job. Where's Bart?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's okay, Marge. I'll get him. BA-ART!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,MILHOUSE!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,TELL BART TO COME HOME!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,WHO'S NELSON?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, young lady. I want you to march yourself directly to the Kwik-E-Mart and get me some chips and a beer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And get a little something for yourself, sweetheart.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'unno. Drug lab?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Or reading comic books. What am I, Kreskin? You tell me what he's doing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, man. This is the most exciting thing I've seen since Haley's Comet collided with the moon!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sure it didn't.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooo, how 'bout cherry this time? And would it kill you to make some coffee?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why is this taking so long? Bart was born in about five minutes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Really? Well, the time just flew by, didn't it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I see a horn!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aww... Ohh, you look like a little tiny dinosaur.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That is one vicious baby bird.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Enough bickering. I know how to settle this.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If anyone wants me, I'll be eating alone in the basement.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid cards.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm proud of you, boy. Mmmm, loganberry.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The chair? How come they only do crucifixions during sweeps?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Woo hoo! Marge, they found a donor! I'm saved!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This is legal, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who wants to see their sexy new daddy?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Later, chickie-pie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You sent me to the chair.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know you are, but what am I?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's hammer time, Snitchy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, my God!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Shut your squeal hole, booze jockey. I'm gonna, like, totally waste you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yoink.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't worry. I'll protect you... Little dude.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,There. Now no murderers can get in... or out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You are sooo dead.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come here, you little--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Daddy would like a word with you, Barty!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I look so youthful and hunky.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The kid's gotta die.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I love my son.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,More than a lush head of hair?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't make me choose!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nooooo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I love you, son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll show you, hair!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Idiot?! Why you... little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,... Show you...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,... I'll Kill you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It wasn't me, it was the hair!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Going where?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mama took those batteries / She took 'em away / Mama took those batteries / Size double A...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ooh. How are Bart and Lisa gonna get out of this one?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bor-ing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Huh? Oh, okay... Let's see... ""pause,"" ""three,"" no ""fa-fa""...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hee hee hee hee. Look how cute they are.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look at him go.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ohh... Ahh...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I just lost my appetite.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait, mine came back.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I know how to cheer you up.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This little piggy went to Kwik-E-Mart, this little piggy went nuts, this little piggy went surfing, and this little piggy went--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ooh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, Marge! Maggie lost her baby legs!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right. I got it. Come on. Get... off the...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Is there anything you can prescribe, doctor?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello-- Oh, great. Mormons.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh? What are you talking about?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, we can't compete with that, but--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It made me angry, Jerry. Angry and tired.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"One-eyed, two-timing ! I'm gonna !",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, Maggie. Let's go home.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I was having the most wonderful dream. I had a hat, and a tie with no pants on.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I promise you kids lots of things. That's what makes me such a good father.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, that would make me a great father.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, four A.M. Now I'll never get back to...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Magilla Gorilla, gorilla for sale..."" Hey, you shouldn'ta oughta taken my banana, Mr. Peebles.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Screw this. Hang on, everyone. We're takin' the ol' Simpson shortcut.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So long, suckers!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eat my dust, suckers!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mmmm. Ugh, pesticides! Carbomate, if I'm not mistaken. Yep, Carbomate.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I see it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, way out in the sticks like this, it could only be hillbillies.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lower! Lower!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yep. That's where they cook up their ""vittles.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, remember where we parked.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah, couldn't put it down.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon boy, let's get me a six-pack.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ohhh, that sounds like a wager to me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Life jackets?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Tow rope?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Skier?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Here we go!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, look at it go.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Faster, Marge! Faster! The snapping turtles are massing!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Heads up. Comin' through. Look out! Hey, volley ball. Can I play later? Hi, Apu.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Higher!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bye-bye, fishies! Higher! Higherrr!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm soaring! Soaring majestically like a candy wrapper caught in an updraft! Higher, Marge! Higher!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Higher, I say! I want to soar higher than any man has ever soared! I want to look down on the clouds with contempt! I want to sneer at God's creation and spit on his -- uh-oh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, this is not good.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, nuts.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What? Oh, already?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, lady. I know you. You're Kim Basinger",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ohhh my God, I am such a huge, huge fan of yours, Miss Basinger.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I am a married man...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Billy Baldwin!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, what are you two kids doin' in my neck of the woods?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait! Tell me over breakfast. Who's for pancakes?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I don't want to be a bother. Anyway, what are you two big Hollywood stars doing in good ol' Springfield?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, why didn't you move to, sayyy... Bethesda?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, tell you the truth, I'm not even sure.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A gallon of wheat grass juice, a five pound wad of tofu, some jellied zinc, and a couple-a pairs of $600 sunglasses.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You shouldn't have to survive on dry crumbly muffins from... the Gersh Agency. You should let me do your shopping. I know where I can get you some great muffins.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, fine. But I could do all kinds of stuff for you. I noticed that skylight in your bedroom's broken.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Please, Homer. C'mon, if you let me hang around a while, I can do all kinds of stuff for ya.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, you owe me that much.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Absolutely. If you promise to keep mine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't read.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I recognized the logo.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nowhere famous.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gersh Agency.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Apu, I'm about to purchase some weird and fruity items, and I don't want any guff. First of all, I'll need the following mushrooms: portobello --",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Porcini --,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Chanterelle --,,,,,
Homer Simpson,AAAnd Shiitake.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nothing, nothing. I'm just broadening my horizons. Uh, by the way, do you have extra-wide bumper stickers for a Humvee?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooo, me-ow.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll get it! I'll get it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ron Howard?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Really? You giant stars consider me a friend? Well, for the first time in my life I feel like I'm somebody. Ronny, are you also my close friend?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's called a Lawnmower. I invented it. You want one?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sure. We'll all stay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll do that! You go upstairs and have a beer.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Kent Brockman. Please.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, you know me. I love animals. Beef, chicken, veal... if you're not part of the solution, Marge, you're part of the problem.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Imagine Films.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A, uh... division of, um... Homer-Co.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And lift, and strain, and hy-per-extend, keep those knees rigid, jerk that lower back...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's right, force it. Whip that neck.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, there's that movie script I wrote. Where did you find it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The important thing is, it's got the perfect part for you. Either one of you. It's about a killer robot driving instructor who travels back in time for some reason. Ron Howard's attached to direct.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, he expressed an interest.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Did too!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You lie!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So you're saying you don't want to star in my movie?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, if Alec is out, I'm out too. You're on your own, Potsie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I might have.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I can't. I promised I wouldn't.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who the hell are you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, I'm gonna let you guys in on something. But you've got to keep it much more secret than I did.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Unbelievable?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nothing, nothing. Good hustle.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm looking at you, Horshak.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay, it was me. I'm sorry I blew your secret. But you don't know what it's like to be a nobody. I just wanted to bask in your reflected glory. Reflected glory!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But where will I bask?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, Ron, we're not wanted here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, I'll go. But the next time you want someone to remind you which brother is which, or smell your hair while you're sleeping, just remember, old Homer won't be here anymore.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, how could Alec and Kim just cut me out of their lives?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"When Kim makes a Manwhich, she uses foccacia bread. And would it kill you to put some fennel in it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it was so great. I didn't have to fake it with them. I was actually excited to hear about their day.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Was it the dog from the Beethoven movies?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Our dog isn't famous. And you kids aren't exactly John and Joan Cusack. And you. You couldn't open a movie if your life depended on it. I'm about ready to ankle this family.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,See? It's like we don't even speak the same language anymore. The only one who understands me is that guy who married Martha Raye.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmmm... She may not be famous, but she's right. Those big shot stars used me up and spit me out. I did their laundry, got their pictures developed, took their garbage to the dump... And I've still got a car full of their crap. Crap, eh...?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Attention starstruck fools!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Step right up and see the world's greatest mobile collection of Alec-and-Ron-and-Kim-arabilia.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Only 5, no wait 10 dollars. You heard right, 20 dollars.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's right, Mister Tough Guy can't handle a little penicillin. Oh, and look at this. We can't even pay our bills and they're drinking Royal Crown Cola.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah? What have they ever done for you? When was the last time Barbra Streisand cleaned out your garage? And when it's time to do the dishes, where's Ray Bolger? I'll tell ya. Ray Bolger is lookin' out for Ray Bolger!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little--!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, look at me! I'm Kim Basinger, the big movie star! I'm so beautiful! I think I'm so great! I'm too important to take Homer to the Oscars.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gotta-go-thank-you-for-supporting-the-Museum-of-Hollywood-Jerks.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'll never outrun them in a museum!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, God.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, I'll stop.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, I do.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I believe that famous people have a debt to everyone. If celebrities didn't want people pawing through their garbage and saying they're gay, they shouldn't have tried to express themselves creatively.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"In closing, you people must realize that the public owns you for life. And when you're dead, you'll all be in commercials, dancing with vacuum cleaners. Thank you, Your Honor.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'll always have my crank calls. Hello, old lady from ""Titanic""? You stink!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But with college behind us, we'll need careers. And good ones.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Slow down, fellas. I've got a way we can keep our legs, and still have a bright future.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, am I?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's the job of tomorrow... today!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, that settles it. For all those reasons and more, let us choose an electrifying career in... Line.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nuclear power.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Pretty good, huh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, there were script problems from day one.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That was the problem. The important thing is, after all these years of paying my dues, I'm finally getting some decent parts.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I didn't choose to be a gifted actor, Marge. It chose me. I'm merely a vessel through which genius flows. Now help me make up some phony credits.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Good. Good.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know... I have no idea. Hey, Dad. What does the ""J"" stand for?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I can't ask Mom. She's on the run from the law.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No! Homer Simpson does not lie twice on the same form. He never has and he never will.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but they were all part of a single ball of lies. The point is, I'm a grown man, and I deserve a middle name.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Great. I'll go shoot myself for bringing this up.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, look at this place. There's a pond for skinny dippin', a tire for skinny swingin'... I can actually feel the good vibrations.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oww... ch.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You went to Woodstock?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lather, rinse, and repeat. Always repeat.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, I could have lived like that?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ohh, my mother painted that for me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, my God! My middle name is right behind that shrub. I'll finally know what ""J"" stands for! From this moment forth, I will be known as Homer...Jay Simpson. It's so beautiful. What a magical gift for my mother to leave me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll treasure this poncho forever.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"My head full of long, luxurious, hippie hair. I'll do it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm gonna be a hippie, just like Mom wanted. I'm gonna let my spirit soar and love all of God's creatures!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Get off, you stupid dog!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, if I'm gonna be a real hippie, I have to learn from the master, Mr. Bob ""flower child"" Hope.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bummer... love-in... Dean Rusk... By George I've got it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Your potato? You can't like own a potato, man. It's one of Mother Earth's creatures.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No way, narc. Bodily functions are a natural thing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why do you have to turn everything into one big plastic hassle? Marge, you've got too many hang-ups. Like the whole shaving trip. C'mon, I want to see those legs all furry and gross.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, at least lose the bra. Free the ""Springfield Two,"" Marge! Free the ""Springfield Two!""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, Maude. The human wang is a beautiful thing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay. Narc.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Heads up!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Right on.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That was cool. Think I'll stick around. We've got everything we need right here. Good times, sunshine, free love...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Work!? But you're hippies!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What is this place?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Profits, profits, profits! What kinda hippies are you? Peter Fonda must be spinning in his grave.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah? When's the last time you freaked out the establishment? You guys are total sellouts.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, we can sit here all day and play the blame game, or we can start freaking people out. C'mon, where's your freak bus?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A Saturn?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine. I guess the juice business is more important than the ideals our hippie forefathers refused to go to war and die for.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now your freak flag's flying! Let the freak-out begin! Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ohh... we're never gonna freak anybody out with this music. I brought something from my personal stash that'll blow some minds.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey square, expand your mind! The doors of perception are open for business.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Never fear, the cosmic fool is here to blow the lid off your conformist, button-down world!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hi, Marge. We're freaking out squares!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What's in your brand new bag, mama?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge. Not in front of the hippies.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hear ye! Hear ye! The intergalactic jester proclaims this conformity factory closed!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no, no. Marge was definitely freaked out.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh. Pretty, uh, freaky, huh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm sensing some negative vibes here. But I promise tomorrow's freak-out will go a lot smoother.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, b-b-but the poncho...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,B-b-but the poncho...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aww, it was sweet of those guys to blame an oaf, but really it was my fault. I just don't have the discipline to be a hippie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Perhaps in time.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aww, you're just saying that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I do walk through pretty much anything... Ohh, you kids are sweet.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's it! Somehow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sleep gentle hippies, sleep. Let old Homer Jay set things right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good morning, Starshine. Seth.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I picked 'em, juiced 'em, and delivered 'em to every store in town. Your business is saved!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Heh. That's what I thought at first. But then I found the other garden behind the barn -- the one with the camouflage netting.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, now the whole town can benefit from their nutrients!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not so fast, Pig! We're making a stand. A freaky stand! You can smash this drug barn all you want, but first you'll have to smash our heads open like ripe melons!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Seth, Munchie, they can destroy our bodies and our ponchos, but they can never silence our song of protest. ""UPTOWN GIRL / SHE'S BEEN LIVING IN HER WHITE-BREAD WORLD..."" Come on, guys... UPTOWN GIRL...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look at yourselves, pointing guns at your fellow man.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hatred is a cage that keeps us from soaring free. Yes, the sixties may be dead and gone, and its spirit long since extinguished, but its ideals live on.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Freedom...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Love...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And peace.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can't you just prune some of the leaves so I can watch TV?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's no fun.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't make me come up there!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hang in there, son. I'm taking us out for our traditional Sunday brunch.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"He zinged you, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Brunch is served!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why? We're following the rules -- if it has a toothpick in it, it's free.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Cherry Garcia... Honey Bono... Desmond Tutti Fruitti... Lisa, help Daddy find some normal flavors.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nooo, nothing made of dead guys. What's in the back?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hurry up. My hands are getting cold.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sherbet Hoover?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ooooh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmmm, eight dollars a pound... times say, oh, five pounds... is, ummm... let's see, how many pounds in a gallon? Oh, I can't afford that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Unless...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I tell ya, I'm a financial genius. I buy an eight-dollar lobster, fatten it into an eighty-dollar lobster, and eat the profits.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm way ahead of you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hold on. I'm still fine-tuning.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Perfect.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No problem. I picked some up at the store.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nothing's too good for my one and only.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eat, eat! You're nothing but skin and bones.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, together, we weigh three hundred pounds. According to my driver's license, I weigh 140 pounds.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That means that you weigh... One hundred and sixty pounds! Oh-ho-ho, you're doin' great!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good news, my delicious friend! You're going to be a free-range lobster.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, boy, dig in. They'll give you a big, strong thorax.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, look at him cower, just like the boy. I can't stay mad at such a helpless little mammal.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'm gonna get you for that, you little scamp!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Take that, Pinchy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I guess this is it, ol' pal. This is your big day.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, look at the little guy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Feel that, Marge? He likes you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And now for the main course...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Steamed Maine cabbages!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We're not eating Mr. Pinchy. He's part of the family now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Pinchy, I made you some risotto.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What's your problem, Veggie? You don't even eat lobster.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aren't you proud of your big sister, Mr. Pinchy? Hmm? Hmm?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's my girl!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Relax, boy, we're not gonna cook you. Enjoy your day at the beach! Ooh, look.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Here's a little playmate for you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you don't have to take that from no punk-ass crab. What's wrong with you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wooo!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Marge. Pinchy got all dirty in the yard chasing birds. But don't worry. I put him in a nice hot bath.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah... Pinchy?... Pinchy?!... Oh... Pinchy!!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, man, that's good. Pass the butter.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh-huh. Pinchy would have wanted it this way. My dear, sweet Pinchy. No more pain where you are now, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh God, that's tasty. I wish Pinchy were here to enjoy this. Ohhh, Pinchy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I'm trying to drive here!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh. Tape must have fallen off.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There, problem solved.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Relax, she just needs a little lovin'.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, come on, come on. Start, damn you. Start!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Two hours? Why'd they build this ghost town so far away?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's because they're stupid, that's why. That's why everybody does everything.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Three minutes?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do we have to listen to you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm done.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey robot, get your fat, metal ass down here!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Let's see. One, two, three... six whiskeys!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Duh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What the heck is this, a tea party? Somebody kill somebody!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But it's funny, Marge. The guy's sick.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, we've gotta get home. I don't wanna miss, ""Inside the Actor's Studio."" Tonight it's F. Murray Abraham.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,F. Murray Abraham.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can't stop now. We're making great time.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What are you, an animal?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whoever keeps saying ""please stop"" back there, better quit it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, get a load of that toilet.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We're almost home, Dad. Only a couple more times over the horizon.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You just sit back and relax. I'm not gonna let anything happen to my old dad.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yep, that's what happens when you get older. It's one of those natural things. Beautiful in its way.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Excuse me, doctor. I think I know a little something about medicine...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So... you're saying I don't need a new muffler?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I blame myself for this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, Doc. There's gotta be something I can do to help my dad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A kidney? Okay, fine.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I said ""fine."" What is it about the word ""sure"" you don't understand?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Pork chops, sloppy joes, hot dogs, and pork chops?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well now that's what I always thought, but somehow...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Apes-A-Poppin'!"" Oooh, the airline version!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nothing's too good for me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ahhh. I'm the luckiest man in the world, now that Lou Gehrig's dead.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's not an operation, Moe. The doctor says it's just a procedure.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really? You think it's dangerous?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Procedure. Deadly procedure.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now you're just tryin' to scare me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I don't want that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, I guess.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, actually I-- Hey! Quit harvesting me with your eyes!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I've been thinking. What if, instead of donating one of my old, worn-out kidneys, I gave Grampa that artificial kidney I invented?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But I don't want them cutting up my soft, supple body. Why didn't somebody tell me what I was volunteering for? This is everybody's fault but mine.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I owe Dad so much. Those bedtime stories began my lifelong love affair with the printed word.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're right, Marge. I'll do it. But if I die during the operation, will you do one thing for me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Blow up the hospital.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's my girl.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Liability waiver?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but all these skulls and crossbones on here... I don't usually sign stuff like that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I love you, Dad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm not worthy to live among civilized people.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Even those guys look too civilized for me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I could live at sea! The sea forgives all. Not like those mean old mountains. I hate them so much.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmmm... the sea won't stand for this.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, excuse me, I'm fleeing in shame and I'd like to look my best.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um, can I be a mate on your ship? Preferably First Mate.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I like taffy, but I don't deserve taffy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A tramp steamer! That's perfect!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'd like to apply for a job. Any job. If you don't have a captain, I could be that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've been on that one. The taffy shop.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The name on the back says ""Honeybunch.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, actually, you did...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Say, who are you guys?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"H-Heyy, let me off this thing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whew.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Forget what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, back on land, my name was Homer Simpson. And I guess it is here, too. I promised my Dad one of my kidneys, but I chickened out at the last minute and left him on his deathbed.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, yeah, I know...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's the last time I trust the strangest people on earth.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Even the sea won't forgive me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I wish I had that kind of relationship with my father... or my kids. Well, I guess it's up to me to take the first step.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, this is it. No more living in shame. I'm going to show my family the kind of man I really am.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, I'm gonna...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No you're not, Dad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm sorry, Dad. The way I behaved was shameful. I guess fear made me run away. But love made me come back.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, that...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm sorry I ran off again. Oh, I guess Dad must be dead by now. When I get better, and after I've built those shelves for the kitchen, we'll visit his grave...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's a miracle! You recovered!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What? What? Hey!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You butchers! Give it back! Gimme that! Gim--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't you dance out that door you... I'll get my kidney back, old man! You have to sleep sometime!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, I guess you're right. Gimme a hug.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't need two kidneys. I have everything I need right here...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmmm...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yesss, tickling.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'd rather get a message than see another lousy commercial.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, beats work.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you sure this is the sci-fi convention? It's full of nerds.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nooooooooooo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You stupid nerds! He's trying to save you money on long distance!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Neeerrrds!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get out of there!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Hamill, Mr. Mayor, come on!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Homer Simpson -- nerd buster. And I'm gettin' you out of here!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Never!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Follow me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, how was I supposed to know it's not a real spaceship?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Forget Maggie! She's gone!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, it's all-- Hey, I thought you twisted your ankle.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I said, ""woo hoo.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Even during Ramadan?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wha?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nooo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Clear!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The pig is in the poke.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look out, Marge! Cat!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hold it! What's your clearance?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Access denied.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,They'll be fine in half an hour.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmm, still half an hour till dinner. Oh, well...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's a real honor to be guarding your body, sir.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Semi-imported. Keep 'em comin'.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"... And after Moe's, we went to Krustyburger and the mayor got some more change, and I ordered a double double, but they gave me the double double double double. And then Apu gave the Mayor lots of change for...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, honey, don't be so naive. That's how the world works. Sure, the mayor takes a few bribes, but he also makes the trains run on time.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, how'd you get the nickname ""Legs""?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, mini-cannoli!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey! I called that! I saw it first! Come back here!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Milking room? I hope you cows are decent.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh! Crap on a crutch!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,They're milking rats! Milk-ing rats!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, no!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, get that away from me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kids, I don't want you drinking any more milk. Ever.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Go nuts.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You... monster! How could you do that to the children?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And to think, I respected you! And defended you! You wouldn't even be alive if it wasn't for me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, we'll call it even.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my God, I killed the mayor. All right, stay calm. I'll just use the body to stage an elaborate farce, Ã  la ""Weekend at Bernie's,"" and...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,His corpse is climbing the building!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A-- Wait a second. I'm not saving you unless you promise to get that rats' milk out of the schools.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're forgetting, you've got the best bodyguard in the business. Now promise, or I'll let you fall to your death.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shake on it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Relax, you're in good hands. Now come on, I'll pull you up.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, the Mafia guy's all mad. Oh, what are you gonna do? Call your Godfather? Huh? Ooh, Godfather. Break it down!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, don't worry about that, boy. He's already out on bail. Well, I'm off to work.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's my duty, Marge. Besides, those mobsters don't scare me. Bart, would you go start Daddy's car?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What? There's nothing to worry about.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, fine. I'll take a cab.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I get it. You're worried about those mobsters, aren't ya?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You've gotta snap out of this funk, Mayor. I'm gonna take you someplace where you can relax and forget all about gangsters.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, excuse me...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do you have a table for the mayor?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why do you talk that way?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, Mr. Burns, Fat Tony, what's-his-name... Fat Tony?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, Fat Tony. If it's trouble with Quimby you're after--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mayor, Fat Tony asked me to give you this--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh no. Wait... maybe I didn't do it right.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nooooooooo!!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Potatoes are clean. The poison must be in the steak.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yesss! Nobody messes with the mayor when Homer Simpson's on -- Aw, crap.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That guy with the knife sure can dance, huh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I think I saw him in ""Rent,"" or ""Stomp,"" or ""Clomp,"" or some piece of crap.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look out!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gimme that knife!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The force?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Fat Tony.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ohh, I'd say you were luminous, magnetic, incandescent.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really? Would you say I was magnetic?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Aww...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get out of the way you--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I can explain that. You see...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don Rickles zinged you, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eat my dust, dust!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aaah, what's the rush? Might rain next week.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really? You think I should get it washed?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, that's great.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wuss rock?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ten dollars?! What is this, a car wash for millionaires?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey! How did Churchy La Femme get half price?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Senior citizen? Flanders?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, we'll see about that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I wouldn't do that, Reverend. You see, ""Saint Flanders"" is as crooked as you or me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's right, it's my sad duty to rat out this man for defrauding a car wash. How, you ask? With a phony senior discount card!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Did you or did you not use a senior citizen discount card at said car wash?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now I'm not a fancy big-city lawyer...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But it seems to me that a senior citizen has to be over 55. Isn't that so?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And you are how old?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You mean that one with the red paint?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Geez, Flanders. You're 60 years old, and you haven't lived a day in your life.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, Bart!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fire in the hole!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, no more gasoline.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Full power!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You got that right. Throw on the mesquite, Bart!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, well, well. So flawless Flanders needs help from stinky-pants Simpson.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Welly, welly, welly... Mr. Clean wants to hang with Dirty Dingus Magee.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wellity, wellity, wellity...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let's do it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh, the Missus will clean that up.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"First of all, I get five dollars a day plus expenses.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And I'll need your signature... here, here, aaannnnd... initial here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well that's unfortunate. It really is.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Congratulations! Welcome to the Homer Simpson Program.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"One day soon I will come for you, and then the game will begin. Could be in the middle of the night. It could be when you least expect it. Or whatever's good for you. I don't care.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gimme that!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's your problem. You're living up here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You gotta live down here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"In the impulse zone. If you want to be like me, you gotta make snap decisions. Like this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We're going to break the bank at the Monty Burns Casino!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You mean Lisa?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah, right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then we're goin' to Las Vegas! Which is actually back in that direction.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,I think you'll find escape is quite impossible.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey! Lance Murdock!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"He's a daredevil, Ned. He laughs at death.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, ooh, ooh, pick him! Pick him!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fine, I'll do it. Where do you want me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll figure it out. This isn't rocket science.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bo-ring.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Flanders, Don't spill my beer!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okey-doke, let's hit the tables.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I think someone just had his first taste of blood loss.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Let's see... what's Marge's birthday? Barney is July fifteenth, same as Lassie's, so Marge's must be... fifty... oh, forget it. Flanders, what's your birthday?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Seven, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Way to go, Flanders. The Bible's finally pulling its weight. Got any more holy numbers?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,One betting disk please. Watch and learn.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, there you go. Now how 'bout a drink?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that. That can be treated with our good friend alcohol. You might want to write that down. Where the hell's your notebook?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, never mind. Just pay attention.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Slave girl? Oh, slave girl?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whuh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah. Two more of these, please.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And for you, Ned?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Welcome to my world.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The what now?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, of course a-- Who are you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, smooth move, Flanders!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Eeech.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay... okay... okay... okay... okay... okay... okay. Okay, you're saying that Ned and me married you two?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ned, no! Think of your wives!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute. This could be some kind of scam -- or possibly, scam-ola. We would remember if we got married.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ahh, precious memories.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What did you call me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sure. Sock it to me, baby.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We are so dead.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ladies, we want to do the honorable thing. So breakfast is on us, with full waffle-bar privileges. But first, I'm afraid we have some bad news. The waffle bar is closed. I'm sorry. I'm so very--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But Ginger, honey, I am not the catch I appear to be.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Are you sure? Oh, rats. No offense, Sweetie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Geez, I've never seen anyone so whipped so fast.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't know, Flanders, having two wives could have its advantages.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Chop, chop, dig, dig. Chop, chop, dig, dig. Chop, chop, dig, dig...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I hear digging, but I don't hear chopping.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, a friendly bee.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ow, that sting hurt so much. We gotta get outta this, Ned.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Blame me if you must, but don't ever speak ill of the program. The program is rock solid. The program is sound.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, those awful women want their omelettes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ginger throws Ned a kiss.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A lion!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The Moody Blues!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What if we switched wives? Would that help?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hel-lo. Our ticket to freedom.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So long, su--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But Amber, I can change!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, let's get our stories straight for Marge and Maude. We were out buying them fabulous gifts...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Because we love them, Jackass.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Anyhoo, we came out of Walmart, when suddenly one hundred spaceships...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're right, you're right. Fifty spaceships, beamed us aboard. They gang-probed you, while I discovered an invention that blew their heads up and saved America.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Would you rather tell Maude the truth?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I only saw them from the back, 'cause they were so busy gang probing you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, little birdie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ah!! Cover your eyes!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Boooo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, stupid Isotopes. Hurry up and lose so we can get out of here!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Because, I loved them once and they broke my heart. Let that be a lesson to you, sweetie: never love anything.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Especially me.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Kids, the carnival's in town for one night only! And they've got cotton candy and hats with feathers and there's no lines because all the stupid kids have curfew! So-- Oh, right. Sorry.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Hey, I know you. We were in the same pyramid scheme.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah. I'm gettin' tired of them pointing and laughing at us.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Football's so great.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Me? Nah. Unless there's a coupon for it. Nah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Homer Simpson at the Super Bowl?,,,,,

Homer Simpson,Phone?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dog, cat?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I can't wait. Look, Marge, I had a scorecard printed up at that all-night scorecard place.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're thinking of all the other years. This year's shows are classics.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There's ""The Laughter Family."" That's animated. Networks like animation 'cause they don't have to pay the actors squat.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Gee... I never thought I'd say this about a TV show, but this is kinda stupid. Hey, ""PoliceCops."" That sounds like a lethal combination.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Isn't bad? Tell me one thing mankind's ever done that's any better.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is better.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He's named like my name!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow. They've captured my personality perfectly. Did you see the way Daddy caught that bullet?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't confuse Daddy, Lisa.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Y'ello... yes, this is the original Homer Simpson. Who's this?... The Debbie Pinson who was the homecoming queen at high school?... Yes, I'm still available.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, that was Debbie Pinson. DEB-BIE PIN-SON.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Local Man Has Same Name. A TV character has the same name as Springfield resident Homer Simpson.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And that's the end of that chapter.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right. And what's the name?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Take it or leave it... Carl.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mmm, who knows? Maybe I'll have to foil an assassination, or stop a peace conference.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yup. Right down to the scarf.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's going on? That guy's not Homer Simpson. He's fat and stupid.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no, he can't be. I know, maybe he's just acting stupid to infiltrate a gang of international idiots. Yeah, that's gotta be it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shutup! I'm not your clown! Don't diminish me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Gentlemen, I bid you--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who-o-oa! Who-o-oa! Who-o-oa!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't understand what happened. Why did they change Homer Simpson's character from cool to stupid?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That does it! There's only one thing I can do.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I wish I hadn't bought a hundred of these.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you gentlemen, but you seem to have me confused with a character in a fictional show. Now if you'll excuse me, my fondue is just about...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"People are laughing at me, Marge. Let's get outta here. Forget the baby's medicine.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fine. I'll be in the car, driving home.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh-oh, Spaghetti-O's.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, people. Enough is enough.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The whole town's laughin' at me. Even that cat out there. Bart, kill that cat!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And that big yellow flower.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmmmm, I guess I could... But while I'm gone, keep an eye on that weird-looking kid down there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah. ""Bart.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, so, I just want to know how come you made your Homer Simpson character so...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It better have.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who's Jeremy Piven?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,PoliceCops.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but why does the Homer Simpson character have to be so stupid?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm begging you. I'm a human being. Let me have my dignity back.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Your honor, I'd like to sue the producers of ""PoliceCops"" for twenty million dollars for improper use of my name.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then I'd like to legally change my name.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Any of these will be fine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dynamic, isn't it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's the way Max Power is, Marge. Decisive, uncompromising, and rude.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, briefly.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh honey, they have acids that can burn that off.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nobody snuggles with Max Power. You strap yourself in and feel the G's.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And it doesn't stop in the bedroom. Oh no, I'm taking charge. Kids, there's three ways to do things -- the right way, the wrong way, and the Max Power way.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but faster.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"MAX POWER / HE'S THE MAN / WHOSE NAME YOU'D LOVE TO TOUCH / BUT YOU MUSTN'T TOUCH / HIS NAME SOUNDS GOOD IN YOUR EAR / BUT WHEN YOU SAY IT, YOU MUSTN'T FEAR / 'CAUSE HIS NAME CAN BE SAID BY ANYONE...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You remembered my name!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mr. Power.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So I want the monogram to read M-A-X P-O-W-,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Max Power doesn't abbreviate. Each letter is as important as the one that preceded it. Maybe more important. No, as important.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And if you have enough room, add some exclamation points and a pirate flag.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just takin' care of business.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Homer Sim-- Uh, Max Power.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, isn't it? I got it off a hair dryer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but I usually have three or four.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Tie good. You like shirt?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, this is Thai food. From now on, I want it morning, noon and night.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,When Trent Steel bought me some.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He's Max Power's oldest and dearest friend.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I spit my gum in there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No way, this guy's a winner. He has a company that makes computers, or a computer that makes companies... Anyway, you wouldn't understand.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,For all of us. Look.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This is our chance to rub elbows with Springfield's young, hip power couples... Like me and Debbie Pinson.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Get used to it, honey. From now on, we'll be spelling everything with letters.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nah. Just park it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I counted the pennies in the ashtray.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maarrge... President Clinton!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Me, too. Let's sing the Cinderella song.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh. Here comes Lorne Michaels. Pretend you don't see him.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Anyway, Marge. Uh, how do you feel about the economy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So I said ""if this is the house of pancakes, how come I can't eat the walls?""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I spend a lot of time on the couch...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, no problem.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Woo, privilege!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whuh?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Give something back? Boo! Get a haircut!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Somebody buy this guy a tree so he'll shut up.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, stop shoving! I'm Max Power!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What's going on, Trent? Where are you taking me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, this is the worst party ever.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge. I thought it would be fun to be on Springfield's ""A"" list, but these people are nuts.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sure you can. Buncha no-good do-gooders.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's what I'm saying! See Marge, this guy gets it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Tree-huggers...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I just thought it was cute when you called him...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't lose them!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Eep! Leave me alone! Go swab Begley. He likes it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm free! Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Right after Happy Hour!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, Trent, where's the party bus headed now?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, I learned you've gotta be yourself. G'night, honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I almost forgot. While I was at the courthouse, I had them change your name.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Chesty LaRue.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just try it for two weeks. If you're not completely satisfied, you can be Busty St. Claire.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine. Hooty McBoob it is.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sleep tight, Hooty.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And then the handsome prince realized he had to go to the bathroom really bad. But the evil ogre, Barney, had left the men's room in the most wicked condition. So the prince went out back to the enchanted alley...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sh-sh-sh. Anyway, the prince passed out for a hundred years, until he was awakened by the kiss of a noble raccoon...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm never eatin' chili again. Ooh, chili!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmm, what's an ""eltdown?"" Eh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Door's unlocked.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, don't make me choose.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, I'm going right to the top.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh-uh, no way. I don't want to miss a word.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm picking it up. ""Sala"" seems to mean jerk. And I think ""Manjula"" means some kind of spaceship.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, they're newlyweds. They'll just talk things out and top it off with some lovin'.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, they stole our idea! See, look!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""I Cherish You, My Precious."" Mm, nah. ""To a heckuva blacksmith."" Nah, I already got him one.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""You're A-peeling. Let's Never Split."" That's funny 'cause they're monkeys. So long, rejects.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mornin', Apu. Still in hot water with the squaw?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, she's not gonna leave you right before Valentine's Day. That'd be like going to an air show and leaving before the plane crash.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sweet mint julep... I'll be at Moe's.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, boy. C'mon!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Goood dog! Good doggie! ""Tax Hike Approved""? Bad dog. Bad, bad dog.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now to trim away the fat.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Outlook. ""Vista."" No. ""Spotlight."" ""Mosaic."" Nah.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, sorry, Marge, that's in my stockpile. You can have this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gimme that!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, don't just gasp, read it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I used to take out ads like that when we were newlyweds.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We sold it, didn't we?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, I hate that song.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, honey. I got something really special planned for Valentine's Day.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wouldn't you like to know?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Everybody's marriage is falling apart except ours. See the problem's communication. Too much communication.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, it's worth it. Look, the Taco Bell dog. Yo quiero Ta... Hey, where'd it go? Here boy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This Valentine's crap has gone too far.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And ask yourselves, people, who's to blame for all this?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Will you stop it?! It's easy to blame ourselves, but it's even easier to blame Apu. He's makin' us look bad!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We've gotta stop that traitor Apu.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, Apu. Make your move.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'unno. Gasoline? Axes? I got some stuff in the trunk.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let's roll.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not yet, I'm not. You'll know when I'm driving. And it'll...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Only till eleven.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not entirely.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, baby. We got him now. There's no escape from the airport.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, look! It's Elton John!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not if I can help it. And help it I might.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mr. John. I'm your biggest fan. I've tape recorded all your songs off the radio.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uhhhh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sir Elton, my noble friends and I would like to dub you a Knight of the... Grand Concourse.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How the hell should I know? Just get in this cage.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not so fast, Apu!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We're putting an end to your insane Valentine's rampage. Never again will good, lazy men have to... What the--?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh no you don't!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you with the scarf! Stop skywriting!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I am so sick of that damn code!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If you won't stop, then I'll stop you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lousy message.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Correction. Kill us both.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow! Prickers! Owwww!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Roses. So many roses.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Roses.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I think I have a collapsed lung, but okay!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no let me out! Let's get outta here!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You drive. I eat.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I saw Krabappel's butt. I paid.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, Mom / Flanders, woman!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ohhh, you suck, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow. Did you see that thing, Marge? So powerful. So commanding. So forceful and raw. It didn't ask, it just took.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Canyonero...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, a red one! Can I buy that? Please?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Will do!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And that's it, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But that's not for awhile, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sweet...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, crap! It's a girl's car. I can't drive this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shut up! Screw you guys!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where's your keys? I'm takin' your car to work.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Are you saying I'm gay? Because if that's what you think, then just come right out and say it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sucker.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A three-chambered peanut! Marge, look what I did! Come quick! Hurry! Marge?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you've been out there all morning.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So... lying on the couch and eating stuff isn't the same if you aren't around to see it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, please come in. Maggie smells bad. And the cat wants something, but I don't know what.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, that's a turn-off.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,At least I've got a license.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, kids, I went too far.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've seen plays that were more exciting than this. Honest to God. Plays.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't wanna pay four bucks to watch some monkey wannabe lay in the sun.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, honey. Daddy will fix that broken animal.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm not gonna hurt him. I'm just gonna wake him up.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh-oh. Here's your slingshot, Lisa.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, kids. I know just what to do. Jumanji! Does anything from the movies actually work?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Back! Back, I say!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh no. I'm out of popcorn.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You throw your peanuts!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ohhh, when will Detroit build a sun roof for the husky gentleman?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, thank you, God. And thank you Porta-John. You really saved my...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who's out there?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'm gonna die! Jesus, Allah, Buddha, I love you all!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nice rhino.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no! She's not gonna make it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, give me a minute...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge, you saved me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is there anything that guy doesn't know?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'm sure of it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'd like to read the following statement, but I do so under my own free will. It has come to my attention that NBC sucks. I apologize for misleading you and urge you to watch as many FOX shows as possible. So in summary, NBC bad, FOX good. CBS great.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"19-- 1939?! Oh my God, I've gone back in time!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've got to warn everybody about Hitler! And get to the ice cream store!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shut up! You haven't even been born yet.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh boy, am I glad to see you guys.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Let's party!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's no way to address Sir Drinks-A-Lot.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Marge, what's your favorite radio station?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, Marge?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's your favorite radio station?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, that's super! See you later.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but it's twice as much as a deadbeat dad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They know I'm kidding.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, Bart, it's your turn to pick. Where are we headed? Bowling? Demolition derby? P.J. O'Harrigans? Isn't that a funny name? Huh? Huh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We did a Lisa thing last month. And I'm glad we did, but now I think we should do something normal people would like.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Go ahead, sweetie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no! Ho, ho. I'm not falling for that again. If it doesn't have Siamese twins in a jar, it's not a fair.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We're gonna go see Marmaduke?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What? And Marmaduke doesn't?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This is all your fault for trading away your turn. Just for that, no dessert tonight!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Good ol' government.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thank God for grave robbers.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fonzie's jacket!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who's Fonzie?! Don't they teach you anything in school? He freed the squares.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where? I don't see that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Relax. I'm just boning up on the ol' Constitution.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I didn't mean to! Look!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wha?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Finally, a company that understands my needs.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So we're even then?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's called caring, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ya gotta admit, Marge, that's a lot more roaming.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, this is pretty comfortable. That Andy Capp was onto something.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just pretend it's a tree, honey. Or as we say at OmniTouch, a Progress Tree.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wha?! I heard a yell. Did you touch a wire?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nothing. They just needed a place to put all the electronic gizmos, and I know how much you like that sciencey stuff so I...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, Lisa, try and see this from the OmniTouch Corporation's point of view.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hm. That thought never occurred to me. Funny how your mind works in a crisis.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, what's your favorite movie?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's right, ""The Odd Couple."" So meet your comically mismatched roommate, Bart Simpson.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, anything spicy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Great. I'm gonna eat mayonnaise!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, well, if it isn't Frick and Frack, Jack and Jill, Fred and Ethel, the Three...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, stop squeaking your chair!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If you've got to do something, click this pen.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, that looks like fun.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're on! Lisa, you play winner.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, honey, you missed a great race. Bart was winning, but then he said ""this is stupid"" and he stopped, and I won!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you're mad at me. That wasn't your mayonnaise, was it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maybe you'd feel better if we watched some TV together.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No it's not.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, here's something you'd like. ""When Animals Attack Magicians.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Awful entertaining.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Somebody wants mommy to change baby's diaper.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes it is.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Great. Maybe on the way back we can swing by the demolition derby and have a nice talk.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, that's a relief.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Give it a try, honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's true. I'm always making clever noises, and she never chuckles at 'em.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no you don't. Screw that touchy, queery crap! We'll take the harsh antacids. Nothing's too good for my little girl.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I sure settled his hash. Imagine that quack thinking you'd try one of those crazy New-Age cures.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sure they are, honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm sorry, Lisa. Oh, it's not your fault. I know we love each other, Dad, but we're two very different people. And, much as I hate to say it, as time goes on, we'll probably just drift further and further apart.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Lisa, honey, I won't ever let that happen.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nah, you must be thinking of your mother. I'm always exploring alternatives and expanding my horizons into realms of... Can't we just go in?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh good, I've been meaning to buy a ""Dream Catcher?"" Gimme a break.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Other cultures are fine. I'm just saying I can get along in life without a ""tooth brush.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And a ooga-booga to you too.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Absolutely not. My little girl's tummy hurts. Do you have anything to stop her complaining?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Let's try some oil of Lorenzo. And, uh, what's keeping Joan Rivers alive?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh no. No freezing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can you pee in it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Me too.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, my.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,OOH EEE OOH AH AH / TING TANG WALLA WALLA BING BANG / OOH EEE OOH AH AH / WALLA BING BANG TING TING TOOO!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Heyyy, this piece of junk is finally doing something.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah... art.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo! Sensory deprivation kicks ass.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, I'm ready to get out now... Yoo hoo! Hippie lady! Hippie lady?! Hey! Hippie lady!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whoa! What's going on? Ow! Oh! This inner peace stuff is tough on the old coconut.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hippie Lady I wanna get out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I told the witch doctor there's tightness in my chest. Bom-bom-bom-bom... I told the witch doctor he had to run a test...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hi sweetie.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I went on a wild ride without ever leaving the building. How was yours?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Like what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whoa, look at that car burn! Does it get any better than this?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So I said to that nurse, ""You can take your free tetanus shot and shove it.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You better believe I did.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I really gave him no choice. Y'see...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Must eat beef... must defeat guy I just met...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait. There's a place like that in Springfield?! Then why are we eating this crap?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, everybody, we're going to the Slaughterhouse!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Didn't I?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow. It's even more wonderful than Lisa said!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute. Is this the biggest steak you've got? 72 ounces? I thought this was supposed to be a steakhouse, not a little... girly... underpantsy... pink doily... tea party place.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, I'll have that one. And to drink... ... meatballs.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They like me because I'm brave.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah? What do you know about it? Y--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's you! You're him! You're Tony Randall!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Greenhorns! Who's a greenhorn? What's a greenhorn?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you're just jealous 'cause you don't have the belly for it anymore. Mr. No-Belly... Mr... Hasn't-Got-A-Belly...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Huh? Oh, right. The steak.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So much steak... lungs filling... sinuses packed with meat...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lousy drunks. I'll show them.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's happening to me? There's still food... but I don't want to eat it. I've become everything I've ever hated.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"My hat's off to you, Red. You're a true American hero. And you did it with style and dignity and... Hey, you're not breathing. Don't people usually breathe?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"He called me ""Greenhorn."" I called him Tony Randall. It was a thing we had.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yes he will! And on time, too!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I've got to, honey. I owe it to ol' Red, as both his friend and his killer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't you have school?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, touchÃ©.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bye, Marge!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Aren't you gonna say bye?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That didn't sound like you meant it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's more like it. So long, suckers!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you gotta... Come on! Ah! Now I'm gettin' the hang of this thing. I don't know why I didn't become a trucker before.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah? My left arm says different.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Piece o' cake. Just need a little truck-driving music.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah... the open road.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That little punk. I'll teach him some manners.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ohhh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That little punk.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sure thing, Gwenn.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aww... that's a nice, friendly gal.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wouldn't it be great to live right here at the truck stop? Watching all the people come and go. You could have a different best friend every day.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Great. I'll write your mother and tell her the marriage is off. And then when the paperwork is done, I'll make Gwenn my wife.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,For now...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It ate everybody.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I bet ol' Red caught himself a mess o' catfish with these fishing sticks.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Relax, boy. We're ahead of schedule.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ten hours?! We gotta roll!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, yeah. I need something that'll keep me awake, alert, and reckless all night long.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sold!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No problem. I'll balance it out with a bottle of sleeping pills.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay-We're-All-Set-Let's-Put-The-Pedal-To-The-Metal!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I whole-heartedly-agree. Oh-man-I'm-really-wired. This-is-a-big-mistake-I-can... Ohhh, here comes the sleeping pills. So drowsy. Pep-pills-perking-up-again. I-could-drive allll Niiight...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I fell asleep at the wheel! But we didn't crash. It's a miracle!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You'll never believe what happened. I fell asleep at the wheel and the truck drove here by itself.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The what now?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The trucks drive themselves?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm not really a trucker, so I don't talk to the rep that often.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow! You guys are even lazier than me! Well, don't worry. I'll keep your secret.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Bart, watch me run down this old lady.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The second I let go of the wheel, this little wonder kicks in.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And if scaring old ladies don't float your boat, watch this!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon out, boy. It's windy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Relax, everybody! The Navitron Auto-Drive System is driving the truck for me! But keep it a secret! It's a big scam! Okay?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, son. It's one of nature's most beautiful sights -- the convoy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I shoulda known. They're hazing us, to initiate us into the truckers' fraternity.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thank you sir, may I have another?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, why do all my trips end like this?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eat water, good buddy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I think we lost 'em, Bart.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, well, well. Looks like we've got ourselves a showdown, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm keeping a promise to an American roadmaster.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Red. The trucker. Big fat guy, couldn't handle his steak?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We'll get past that barrier somehow. Ol' Blinky here will find a way.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm not Red, I'm Homer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ten-four, dead buddy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This is Red Barclay's shipment. On time, as always.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well... the last time I saw him, he was in a big plastic bag.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, son. I guess it's time to go home.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, but I'm sure the good Lord will provide.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thank you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, man. This is the hottest Easter ever.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Relax, I found it in the dumpster.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Heads up!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, hel-lo!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"'Course not. There's no pain in the Garden of Eden. Hey, you must be Eve.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Looks like God made you out of my sexiest rib.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is there!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't mind if I do!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, good morning, Lord. I just have to, ah, compliment you on this beautifully crafted mate.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, you're too kind. And wise, and righteous... I can't believe you don't have a girlfriend.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No problem, Lord. And it would be even easier to avoid that temptation if I had a few extra wives.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just sayin'...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, I already gave him a name. ""Land monster.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Branch monster.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why won't you be art?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're pretty uptight for a naked chick. You know what would loosen you up? A little fruit.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And you keep saying we need to do things together...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, um, uh... I think we should see other people?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Usually a mink massage makes me feel better. But something's missing now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I didn't say stop.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, just like yesterday.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I gave a rib to Eve, and now she's gone forever.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, poor Eve. What are you doing out there in that horrible place?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This is my fault. I shoulda stood up for you during that whole ""Applegate"" thing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't say that! Maybe I can sneak you back in. I mean, God can't be everywhere at once, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, Eve. Hurry!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ohhh, my dear, sweet Eve. I love you even more than the butterscotch pond or the porno bush.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, there, there, I'm sure he's gone to a better place, Lord.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, now let's not do anything rash... God is love, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ohhh, my back. So this must be that pain thing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah. Definitely pain!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This sucks. Things were so much better back in the Garden.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The pie shall be cut in two. Then each man shall receive... death. I'll eat the pie.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh, it's not the end of the world.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I never used those pizza coupons.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Where do you think you're going, Missy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, I smell barbecue!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, look! Oh, they're out of hot dogs! And the cole slaw has pineapple in it! German potato salad!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You put da beer in da coconut and drink it all up / You put da beer in da coconut and throw da can away...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You throw da can away...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You throw da can away...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm out of beer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But, Marge, I'm not like other men. That's why you buy my pants at that special store.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fine. I'll drop everything I'm doing just for you. But you'll have to live with the guilt of ruining my Saturday. Can you live with that, Marge? Huh? Can ya?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"'Scuse me, I have a few questions for Pop.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look Pop, I'm planning some expert home repairs, and I need a pair of bolt cutters, or wire cutters, or something to get the lock off my toolbox.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'd like to return this barbecue kit.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A man in an apron!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no, I'm into chicken.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmmm... hippo...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"How 'bout it, Bart? Would you like a new backyard barbecue pit?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We can all burn evidence in it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There, that wasn't so hard... was it, honey?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, sweetie. Daddy'll take over.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah. That's a fine looking...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, no big deal...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid Lisa.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You gotta build fast! Cement drying!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, let's see...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"English side ruined! Must use French instructions! ""Le grille?"" What the hell is that?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Come on... fit you...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, that's one fine-looking barbecue pit... Why doesn't mine look like that?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why?! Why must life be so hard? Why must I fail in every attempt at masonry?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, if you'll follow the flashlight, you'll see the receipt embedded here and here... and elements of the box here, here, and possibly here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, you...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, of course. Any kid would love to have this, uh... activity center. It teaches them while they learn.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But, but...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll never get rid of it. It'll follow me to the ends of the Earth!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right! My bumper fell off!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not my fault! Act of God! Act of God!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,Take the kids out back.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll handle this.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah? Prove it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh... All right! Just go ahead and sue me. Everybody else does! The average settlement is $68,000.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You mean this hunka junk? This isn't art. Just a barbecue that pushed me over the edge. Didn't you? Didn't you?! You stupid so...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I got that, lady.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This lady says I'm an artist.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"In high school I was voted ""Most Likely to be a Mental Patient, Hillbilly, or Chimpanzee!""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So you'd better catch the fever. Catch it...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, all great artists love free food. Check out Jasper Johns.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Woo hoo! Look, Marge, my first sale! In your face, Jasper Johns!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm gonna be an outsider artist! That way, I can turn all these old baseball cards, Disney memorabilia, and antiques into something valuable.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I've always had an interest in art, dating back to my schoolgirl days when I painted portrait after portrait of Ringo Starr.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I think I remember my own life, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Astrid said the key to my art is anger. But you know me, I'm Mister Mellow.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Look Marge, they're advertising my show in ""Art in America."" It's the first time I've been mentioned there, that I know of.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Good night.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're upset about something. Is this about that trip Barney and I took to Machu Picchu?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, honey, I've always liked your art. Your paintings look like the things they look like.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Frankly, I'd be a little turned on.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I've screwed up everything I've ever done. I mean, look at Bart. But I finally found something where people worship me for screwing up. And that feels pretty good.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,Is that our house?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And is that us on the roof?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are we kissing?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A mascot contest?! I'm sure to win that. Unless one of you jinxes me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Shut up, shut up, shut up!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, you said I couldn't do it, but here it is! Meet Abby the Olympic Tabby.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just for the prototype, honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Knowing you always hate my first idea, I prepared a backup. How about a big Olympic hello for Springy, the Springfield Spring!",,,,,

Homer Simpson,I don't have time for that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ohh, yeah...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, all right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whew. All that seizing made me hungry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The toilet recommended a place called AmericaTown.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't believe they stuck us at Taxachusetts.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you know, I once knew a man from Nantucket.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let's just say the stories about him are greatly exaggerated.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, they got our number.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,One square watermelon please.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's worth every cent. I'm tired of fumbling with round fruit.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, of course. You're right. You know, I read about a Shinto tea house where they practice the traditional... Run, Bart!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Looks like he's doing a commercial.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mmm... fifty dollar pretzel. Hey, what's Baby Huey doing?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmmm...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Spare some salt, tubby?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, that's mine!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Like we say in my country, ""Hasta la vista, baby.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, and I'm Clobbersaurus.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,All hail Emperor Clobbersaurus!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thank God. I couldn't take another minute in this hell-hole.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'm sick of doing Japanese stuff. In jail we had to be in this dumb Kabuki play about the forty-seven Ronin and I wanted to be Oshi, but they made me Ori.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I didn't... What is it? Lunch?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, ichiban. I'll show you something Japanese.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's a crane. The Japanese believe they bring good luck.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shimatta baka-me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This sucks. What else is on?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I haven't talked it over with the family, but I think we'd all like a free dinner at AmericaTown.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ignor-- what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Do ""OW THAT HURTS.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Could someone please whack my hernia back in?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is the answer Japan?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why are you so cruel?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, at least we're past the lightning round.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmmm, I see... I sure hope they don't have an ice cream round.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge! Your shoe!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, at least we'll die doing what we love... inhaling molten rock.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It burns! It burns!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It burns! It burns!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Before I go, I want to say something. Game shows aren't about cruelty, they're about greed and wonderful prizes like poorly-built catamarans. But somewhere along the line, you lost your way. For shame.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I love this show. Take that, you stupid hosers!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Undo! Undo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My children deserve to see me get a free gift.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I like the nice things you said about me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, I, uh, love your planet deeply and am interested in purchasing one of your electronic autos.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What kind a mint?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, it's got a lot of other problems too.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Relax, we're in an electric car.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,See? Everything's fine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, dolphins.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oopsie.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hi, girls.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ohhh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Salt water seems to be good for it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um, I'm sorry, the car did not meet my eco-concerns. Can I have my prize now?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We didn't? That's odd. Seems like we would've done that right after we left the car place.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, here it is, so we can open it and find out now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aww, movie tickets! That hardly seems worth destroying a car.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who else is in it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mel Gibson is just a guy, Marge. No different than me or Lenny.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmmm, I'm not certain about Lenny.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, you're thinking about me, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I will now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bo-ring.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,At least the Jimmy Stewart version had that giant rabbit who ran the savings and loan.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, that was a stinker.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you're just saying that because your ""boyfriend"" was in it. I'll bet you would've hated it if me and Lenny were Mr. Smith.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that's it! I'm telling Mr. Stupidest man alive what I really thought of his movie! Hey, Gibson!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Got a pencil?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thanks.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,stupid...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,'Preciate it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Door, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And I've been lookin' for you, too, pal!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen, Gibson, I'm tired of Hollywood pretty boys like you and Jack Valenti thinking you can have any woman you want. You see this?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It symbolizes that she's my property and I own her.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Really? You want my help? Marge, did you hear that? Mel Gibson wants my help! Mel Gibson!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shuut-uup...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"She's always doing that, Mel.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Guilty as charged.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You had me at ""Hello.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A mini-van... Oh boy, you celebrities sure know how to live. What is this? Toyota Previa?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sweet.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, while Mel and I are working, why don't you guys do the town? I hear all the stars eat at a place called Planet Hollywood.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, son, but we're going to be very busy. Mel's movie really stinks.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, this opening scene should be in fast motion. Everybody likes that 'cause it looks funny.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I mean Lisa.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, here you need a musical montage where you try on lots of funny hats. It'll let us see your playful side.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They will if you set up that the dog is evil. All you have to do is show him doing this and people will suspect the dog.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ah-ah-ah! Now here's your biggest problem of all...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And it was fine for the 1930's. The country was doing great back then. Everyone was into talking. But now, in whatever year this is, the audience wants action! And seats with beverage holders, but mainly action.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh! Mel, it's the most boring piece of garbage I've ever seen. And it's not easy for me to say that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It was symbolism. He was mad.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Piece o' cake. Now where's that kid with my latte?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,... we-shot-last-night...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mel, you're coming off desperate. Roll it, Louie!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Here comes two!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I second that motion...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,...with a vengeance!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Those movies sucked. I only saw 'em to get Marge into the sack. PS: mission accomplished.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, guys like me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Do the words ""Executive Producer"" mean anything to you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We'll talk.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Watch out! Comin' through! Mach schnell!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm on it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"How old are you, anyway?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry I asked.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, crap! Here they come!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, come on, turn that down-under frown upside down. We're not finished yet.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No time talk! Need steal car! Must save powerful but controversial movie!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hel-lo.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Quick, Mel, get in!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Movies aren't stupid! They fill us with romance and hatred and revenge fantasies. ""Lethal Weapon"" showed us that suicide is funny.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Before ""Lethal Weapon 2"", I never thought there could be a bomb in my toilet, but now I check every time.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They are my only escape from the drudgery of work and family.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No offense.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I think we lost 'em.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, wait. There they are.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Great idea, Mel. Now it's my turn.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm tired of running away. Did ""Braveheart"" run away? Did ""Payback"" run away? It's time we showed those suits what we're made of.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's your plan, from ""Braveheart."" Your army mooned the enemy until they could take no more and surrendered.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Actually, I didn't see it, but on the poster it...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think so.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't get it, Mel. How can you be so calm and cool? My stomach's full of vomiting butterflies.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, that's it. Let's get ready to meet our public.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,/ Ow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We shoulda put in the dog with the shifty eyes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'm sorry I ruined your career, Mel.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"How did the country lose its way, Mel? When did we stop rooting for the man with the flame-thrower, or an acid-spraying gun of some kind?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, whatever it is, we've got to get rolling on our next picture.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what about a prequel to something? Everybody loves prequels.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, Mr. Difficult. How about a teen sex romp where you and your buddies are always trying to get some?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, wait. A ghost who wins the lottery! You could be the ghost or the lottery commissioner. Ooh, what about Indiana Jones? Does anyone own the rights to that?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Mel. I fell out.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thank you for getting me out of work.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, he's somethin' else, all right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, that looks like Bart.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hi, Marge. It's me, Homer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What? Time to go?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Candy bar?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'd say he's coming out of the Pep Closet.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,They become your slaves...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's all about trust, honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Some special helpers that'll make you a good boy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sure you do. All your favorite stars have used drugs: Brett Butler.... Tim Allen...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Andy Dick...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, and I'm a size four.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, let's forget all about that drug thing. Why don't you just come down and have some taffy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just take one bite. If you're not one hundred per cent different...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Geez, what's the big deal? Look, I'll even eat some.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Way to guilt him, Marge!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do I get a card?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmm. My career has kinda lost momentum...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I have been thinking about making them into cut-offs...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I tell ya, the kid's a wonder. He organized all the lawsuits against me into one class action.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You know it. Plus he gave me this appointment dealy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Got my whole week in there.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, this thing'll do anything. Watch, I'll ask it how many leagues in a furlong. No, wait... I'll make it say ""Whatsa matta you?"" in Turkish.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And look at this. A cheese grater!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, if you want one, they sell 'em at...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The boy's still studying?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"He's gone from Goofus to Gallant, and we owe it all to mind-bending pills.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, let's go to the waterpark. My ten-year ban ended yesterday.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh... Marge!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really? With butterscotch on it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, this is the greatest gift any wife has ever given her husband.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That was fun. We have to get out more often.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, sure, if it's true.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ray J. funny... or O.J. funny?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Even mine?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I had Lenny's name on that!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maarge. I think Bart's gone crazy!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you found my needlenose pliers.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wake up, honey!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,He quit blinking. He says that's when they get ya.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,After we trusted you...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh. Somebody's gonna have a tummyache.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, there was just air in mine.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We should have paid more attention to these side-effects. It's all here -- erratic behavior, paranoia, diarrhea...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But how do we know, Marge? How do we know?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So I gave up tap for jazz, and I've never regretted it. And here's why...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm on top of it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"My God, is she brave. Standing up to that freaked-out junkie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why don't you just tell everybody?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The frame store! You monster!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And Mark McGwire gave you an autographed bat.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who cares? That man can really slug.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, sweetie. Daddy's got it covered.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"God bless you, Nelson Muntz.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you , you cut me off! Ah, yeah, you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, right. ambulance! Think you're so big with your siren, and your letters on backwards.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Here we are kids -- the zoo.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If he's so smart, how come he's dead?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ooo... pointless nostalgia.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'd sure hate to be him.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I smell cake! Cake that says ""Farewell"" and ""Best Wishes""!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll have you know I wandered off from the tour.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I like food all right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I LIKE PIZZA / I LIKE BAGELS / I LIKE HOT DOGS, WITH MUSTARD AND BEER...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'LL EAT EGGPLANT / I COULD EVEN EAT A BABY DEER... LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA... WHO'S THAT BABY DEER ON THE LAWN, THERE...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, it usually takes a few hours.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks for the chance. You won't never regret this, Mr. Editing Guy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We don't need no stinkin' ""E"". Restaurant Review... No. Eatery Evaluation... No. Food box... Go or no go? By Homer... No. Earl. No. Bill Simpson!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well -- what do you think?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's wrong with it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It was so hard to get to 500 words...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no, you're right. It's a joke. Everyone laugh at the funny joke . I'll be right back with the real review.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Still not clean! Stink of failure still on me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Still not clean! Still not clean!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, what restaurant should we review?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Great. Now, let me think... the food was... not undelicious...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's brilliant. And they have this sweet, sweet chocolate mousse -- really, the only word for it is .",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How about groin-grabbingly transcendent?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We make a good team. A groin-grabbingly good team!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"How about ""screw Flanders""?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, they're both good.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Stop the presses!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, start the presses!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whatever. I'll be at Moe's.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, shh! It's important that no one know that I'm a food critic.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Can ya believe it, Marge? This job is the greatest -- they're paying me to eat!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Welcome to the humiliating world of professional writing. But this is only the beginning...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There's the coffee mug from ""Heartbeeps""!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let me see.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid script! Nearly wrecked Jim Carrey's career! You-- I'm gonna... What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And the view is... beautiful... inspirational... nauseating.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, Marge, I'm making a difference in people's lives!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you gonna fire me for swiping office supplies?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whew.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why, you... You made them cancel ""Platypus Man!""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And the Cosby Mysteries! That show had limitless possibilities!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"For you, perhaps.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've given out my share of bad reviews.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It lost some points 'cause it had a Hot Wheel on it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that's classic.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hm. This pea soup is as weak as the acting, and nowhere near as hammy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The other critics told me to be mean. And you should always give in to peer pressure.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Always.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, not bad... if lasagna is Italian for ""pile of puke.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I hope you cut me better than you did these string beans. Hm, I seem to be missing a piece of my ear. TouchÃ©!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mm.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Marge. I'm afraid this gets my lowest rating ever, seven thumbs up.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm sorry, but your cooking's only got two moves: ""Shake"" and ""Bake.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"People change, Marge. My palate has grown more sophisticated.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh... it's a special time in a boy's life when... Gotta go!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So come to The Legless Frog... if you want to get sick and die, and leave a big, garlicky corpse. P.S. Parking was ample.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,People will think what I tell them to think when you tell me what to tell them to think!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nobody talks to me that way! I'm Homer Simpson! The most powerful food critic in town, who will never get his comeuppance! You hear me? No comeuppance! We'll be right back.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't need Lisa to write a good review. ""The food at the Gilded Truffle really..."" Uh... What's a good word?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sucks! That's great. ""And the bread was really..."" C'mon, help me out here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Rough!"" Ah, I don't know. You've been pitching that all night.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Chewy! That's inspired.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you crazy? A dog can't type. Unfortunately.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really? Like what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge, something bad usually happens to me when I go in anywhere.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A bat! Now that's a new one.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So what are you up to, young lady?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh. Well, I'm glad to see my ex-partner is doing so well without me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pedestrian.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uninspired.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I didn't say stop!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, So full... Bellybutton moving from innie to outie...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, sweet.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh, I've had a good run.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Noooo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Lisa... you saved me! And after all the bad things I said about you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Lisa, the important thing is, I didn't get my comeuppance, and I never will.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know, honey. The important thing is -- run!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Finally getting my comeuppance.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But it was worth it to get back our super Sugar Crisp cereal.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can't get enough of that Sugar Crisp...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Guess I forgot to put the fog lights in...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He's dead!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He's definitely dead!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry. I've got a plan. Okay, Ned, the first thing we have to do is...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,To make sure that no one knows that you're dead. And if anyone asks... you're not dead.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey Maude! Look who's helping me clean the chimney.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hi, Maude. Diddily. I've been having fun with my pal Homer. Diddily.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Relax, I'm fine. But when I do die, I don't want any autopsies.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, it sure is slippery up here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aww, she missed it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Maude, I'm home. Uh-oh. I think I'm having a heart attack.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And that's the end of that chapter.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Try not to look too sad -- it'll seem suspicious.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"When I think about Ned, I can't help but remember the look on his face when Marge drove over...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, wait... What I'd like to say is, we're still looking for the real killers. Anyway, in conclusion, a man cannot be forced to testify against his wife.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We'll miss you, buddy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, we just got away with murder. And it was so easy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, I've never liked that little wiener Milhouse.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But you got to kill...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Y'ello?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who is this?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, it's Homer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dear God, it's Homer. If you really love me, you'll save my life now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, Marge, you hide in the abandoned amusement park.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, the pet cemetery.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, spooky roller disco.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I'll go skinny dipping in that lake where the sexy teens were killed a hundred years ago tonight.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, Flanders, I want you to...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"He's undead, all right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Guess I forgot to put the fog lights in...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Foamy, I want the news, not the weather. Marge, did you hear me zing Werewolf Flanders?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Flanders, stop that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eyes bigger than your stomach, eh, wolfie?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Geez, Marge, tell the neighborhood.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Absolutely.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Doin' what now?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That can't be true, honey. If it were, I'd be terrified.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, those ivory tower eggheads have screwed us again. Let's just have some milk and go to bed...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, this milk's broken.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stop! Ow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm caught on something!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I was gonna loot you a present!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wonders, Lisa? Or blunders?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Implied, Lisa? Or implode?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thank you, sweet clown.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,In death you saved us all.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can still hear his voice on the wind.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just like the dead clown promised.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's us!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Certainly. I am... the, ah, piano genius from the movie ""Shine.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... Shiny McShine?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good-bye Lisa, remember me as I am... filled with murderous rage.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, son. I guess this is the end. But we've both had long, full lives. Oh, right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And there's nobody guarding it. Let's go!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't believe I destroyed the Earth.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're right. I gotta let it go. All that counts is we're alive and rubbing elbows with the greats.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, there's Ross Perot, Dr. Laura, Spike Lee...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, but there's... Dan Quayle and Courtney Love... Tanya Harding... Al Sharpton...?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Tom Arnold?! What the hell's going on?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So we're all gonna die?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The sun? That's the hottest place on Earth!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh no, Rosie O'Donnell.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooo, you don't want to get Zorro mad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not fast enough!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I have to go to ze lobby!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're not supposed to go to the bathroom without washing your hands, either.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,To the top please.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Swim, my pretties.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sh-sh-shh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Woo! You go, Zorro!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why that little... He insulted your honor!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sir, I demand satisfaction.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I challenge you to a duel.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Will you duel, or are you a coward?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, uh. ""H"" is for Homer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Heavyset? What's that supposed to mean?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No Tommy Tune, eh? Oh, that's it. You insulted my honor.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I demand satisfaction! I challenge you to a duel.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really? But you've never given anyone a free beer.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, a free beer! And I owe it all to a little glove slap. GLOVE SLAP...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"BABY, GLOVE SLAP...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Coming through... challenge... duel... Hi Lenny... how dare you... demand satisfaction...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Aisle six?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Duelling at dawn? How did it ever come to this?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sir, that is an insult! I challenge you... What?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, honey, I had the worst nightmare. This glove kept slapping people and I was getting blamed.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"He's out there, isn't he?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I'm not dead yet.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Save me, Marge. I saved you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Marge, that's in the past. Just let it go.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And somebody wanted to get rid of it in April.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Flanders, you gotta help me. Is there a southern couple parked in front of my house?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I was afraid of that. Well, goodbye, my gentle neighbor. You know, I've always wanted to tell you how mu...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, screw it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ooh! How 'bout that house?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lousy show-offs.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, Carter, build us a house, you lazy bum.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, move it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How should I know?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,'Cause I'm trying to think! What would Zorro do?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Zo-rrooo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Rural route 9? That's it! We can hide out at the farm where I grew up!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, it'll be fun. Fresh country air, apples for the pickin'... sing-along hayrides...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Race ya to the swimmin' hole!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Com'on, Maw. Bring the young 'uns! There's no leeches! Lots of snakes, though.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just think of 'em as cats with rabies.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, kitty.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You little scamp.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Absolutely. This is our big chance. The Simpsons will be reborn as a bunch of gap-toothed bumpkins.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's my girl. Let the agriculture begin!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, let's see what the old girl can do.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hang on.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And... there.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now we're talkin'!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Go get Lassie.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This car was made in Guatemala.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I bought these shoes from a hobo.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm sorry, I believe in good grooming.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, what do you know?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that's just superstition.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You watch me. I'll grow something out there.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, I hope I can grow some like that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, a little bit of everything.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Something will thrive in this harsh, merciless soil.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And for those who face nature unafraid, it is they who reap the... ah... I'm down.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Move the handbrake...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ohhh, that's heaven.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it's been a month. Why won't anything grow?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm only one man, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, who am I kidding? I'm no farmer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Leave me alone, you big bully.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, boy. Going back to Springfield would be a coward's way out.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you're right. I'm a coward. I've made such a mess of things. If only there was some magic potion that would make those crops grow...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Easy... careful... steady...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Time to give Mother Nature a little goose.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, Marge, have you ever seen a field glow like that?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Of course not. But you know something? Sometimes you have to break the rules to free your heart.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, when there's nothing left to believe in, believe in hope.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"From the producers of ""Waiting to Exhale.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shut up and kiss me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's time to harvest our radioactive supercrop!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's all it takes. If we learned one thing from ""The Amazing Colossal Man,"" and ""Grasshopperus,"" it's that radiation makes stuff grow real big, real fast.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Only 'cause he tried to reason with him.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Brace yourselves, everybody. You're about to see the hugest, juiciest, possibly super-intelligent vegetables man has ever known. You might want to crane your necks upward now to save time.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ta-da!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, now don't panic. It's possible the giant vegetables are invisible.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ah-ha!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh... Where are you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you're right. This farm's hopeless. Why didn't I listen to those inbred hicks? I guess I'll just go hang myself in the barn.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This better be good.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A sprout!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And there's some more!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who cares what it is? It's growing! I've saved the farm!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look at my babies. This tomato will be Heinz ketchup. And this to-mah-to will be Hunt's catsup.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bup, no fighting, boys.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, great. I got a field full of mutants.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Addictive, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, thanks honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, it's the latest craze. Try some, won't you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't push. There's plenty of tomacco for everyone.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're scaring the customers, honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Those dirty rotten...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I wish I could make a difference, Lisa, but I'm just one man.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How much?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,One hundred and... May I speak to my family for a moment?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Did you see the way Emile's lookin' at Mindy? Hoo-hoo, I think something's going on there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah. Let's take it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We all agree that a hundred and fifty million is an insult. The least we can accept is a hundred and fifty billion.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,They'll be back. We control the world's supply of tomacco and no one can take that away from...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stop eating our future!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get the... get outta... bad animals! Go home!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thank God, there's one left!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, a flying saucer!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There, there. We had quite a scare today. But you're gonna make us millions. Yes you are.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know, honey. But what can I do, as an individual? I wouldn't know where to begin.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I agree, but how?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They're after the tomacco!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, there's absolutely no evidence this is...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I'd rather die!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Take it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, Mindy? How did you want to pay me the hundred and fifty million?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cash'll be okay! Or stock? Does your company have stock?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mindy?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mindy and I are just hammering out a payment plan. We'll talk Monday!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know why we ever left in the first place.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, are we duellin' or what?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think so. The bone stopped the bullet.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,After pie.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Snooze... need more snooze.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Did somebody say num num?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'm twenty-six hours late for work. No time for Maggie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, where's Waldo?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nope. Nope. This would be a lot easier without all these people. Nope. Nope. It's there-- Uh, nope.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Waldo, where are you?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh sure. Single me out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Over there.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Heh, heh. I'd hate to see the look on ol' Burnsie's face if he knew I was just gettin' in. Hee hee.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mmm, who is that? Big ugly nose... bald... liver spot... liver spot... Mmmm.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No! I can't get in trouble if I can't see you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Safe in the core. And now...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is the worst day ever.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mr. Burns is making me eat all these drums of toxic waste.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge, I'm sorry. I can't make it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The cooling tank just blew and they're taking Lenny to the hospital.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, so I'm going to have to work late, instead of seeing you and the kids, which is what I really want.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are poo and ass taken?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Damn! Could my life get any worse?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, guys. Is it normal to see Burns' face on a bowling ball?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What a rotten day!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lenny...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Practice ball! Practice ball!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Real real real real real!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! I'm ten pins away from perfection.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why won't they come over? I'm so lonely.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Get down, get down, get down!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! This is the greatest day of my life!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"In your face, to-do list!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thank you! Thank you! But there was someone else with me on that alley. I'm talkin' about the big man, Carl.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thank you, Bart's teacher. You know, kids, my teachers said I would never amount to anything. And until last week, they were dead right. But now I've achieved perfection.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Any questions?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, Bart's weird friend.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You've got a father. He's just a dud.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Next question.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, the girl Bart has a crush on.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um, how 'bout one not touching your ass?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, this was supposed to be about me. Now, any other questions? Pumpkin face? Headgear? Chicken pox? Smelly? Lazy eye? Spikey head? Okay, class dismissed. Rock on!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, Kent?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well... that would... uh, wait... uh... do I read from the sheet labeled ""Jokes"" or ""Answers?""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dream on, Drunky!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Flavor of the month? Me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I 'unno... Because you weren't cute anymore?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eww, thanks for sharing!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, everybody!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Did somebody say a perfect game?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm doing a walk-on. It's a show business thing. So how y'all doin'? Let's see... What's in the news today?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I thought you never talked.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Remember Springfield, keep on swinging!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, everybody! I'm gonna be on TV again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's right. You've got a special daddy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Woo hoo! First stop, Maude Flanders.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But she said I...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, I know what's going on here. They did it to Jesus and now they're doing it to me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, in bowling ability.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sweet bowling alley balloon. You're my only friend.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What was that about?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, has my life peaked?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mm-hmmm.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're right!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I can't believe it, Moe. The greatest feat of my life is already forgotten.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Save your tears, Moe. Save 'em in a shot glass for someone who still has a shred of hope.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"THIS IS THE END / MY ONLY FRIEND, THE END / WEIRD SCENES INSIDE THE GOLD MINE...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, world, this is it. You know, I always thought you'd die before me. But now as I prepare my soul for an eternity of fire and poking...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I wanna live!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's a glandular problemmmm!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, Morlocks... CHUDS... Mole People!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Lord... you saved me. I guess you had some higher purpose in mind.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not anymore, Ron. Now, I'm looking for something to dedicate my life to. Something noble, but easy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's great. Even big stars take their kids to the zoo.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's it! Kids are the answer! I'll dedicate my life to my children.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No. I don't want your pity or your money.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I do what now?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen, boy... I was wondering if you could use a little more fatherly attention.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can see I'm not needed here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, honey, do you need any help with your homework?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I've been so blind. I'll lavish my attention on Maggie, the forgotten Simpson.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mag-gie. It's me, Dad-dy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Daddy's gonna spend a lot more time with you. Yes he is. Yes he is.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Where's Mag-gie? Where's Mag-gie? Hey, where is she?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,There you are.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hi Maggie! I'm Homie-Womie, the Teletubby. And I'm all man, in case you've heard otherwise. Let's see what's on Tummy-vision!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ow! Ow, that hurts! Owww! Ohhh!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whee! Whee! Don't be scared, Maggie. Daddy won't drop you. Whee!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're a tough cookie, Maggie, but I'm gonna win you over. Just like I did with Lisa.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hi, honey!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, Maggie. You can trust me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Come to Daddy! Come to Daddy!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm sorry, Maggie. I never realized things between us had gotten this bad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What are you pointing at? The ocean?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's a great idea. We'll swim in the ocean.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"See, Maggie. The ocean is just like a bathtub. Except instead of rubber ducks, it has barracudas and moray eels.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nothing to worry about. Just a little wave.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And this riptide is certainly nothing Daddy can't struggle against. Help! Help! Somebody, help!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, current... too strong... I know! If I sink to the bottom I can run to the shore.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maggie! Call Aquaman!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Maggie, you're swimming! You swam out to save me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you do love me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Actually, that was before I went in the ocean.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then don't.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, all I care about is that my little girl loves me. And we're gonna spend a lot more time together from now on.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good girl, Maggie. You knocked down all the pins. But you stepped over the line just a little bit, so I'll have to give you a five.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And that gives you a final score of... two ninety-five.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Looks like Daddy won, but two ninety-five is awfully good for a baby.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes it is. It's very good and you're a good little baby. Yes you are.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And these bean bag chairs look so comfortable.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, there's someone else in here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,He's named after what he is.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, I will have the... Pl_penlÃ¼gen. And don't skimp on the D__dlemÃ¼nch.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Apu, Manjula. You guys are still married?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Pay up, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kids are the best, Apu. You can teach them to hate the things you hate. And they practically raise themselves, what with the Internet and all.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Apu. Sittin' in the ice cream cooler, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whoa, too much information! Thanks for the mental picture. Why don't you tell us what you really think?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Could you be any more...? Hel-lo! Look, just give me some ice cream.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,More than I wanted to knoooow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But the cans seal in the flavor.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, how's the tribe comin' along? Any papooses?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Decided? That's classic. Decided. Babies just happen.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really? On top and underneath?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, don't worry, I can help ya. I'm all about ideas.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kids, come and get it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, this situation is guaranteed to end in pregnancy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Up-bup-bup-bup! That's an Apu question. You're ""Greg.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My mistake. Stay in the moment.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And that's my cue to exit.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I just wanted to invite you to the wrap party. And that's my cue to exit.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man, the last nine months sure were crazy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Apu, you shoulda seen your face when they showed you those babies.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah. It looked just like that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mine tasted like strawberry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmm... Ovulicious.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Free baby cola? Apu hits the jackpot, and I'm stuck with these useless one-tuplets.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've been waiting so long to hear that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, look at that. Ooh, gingerbread house. Hansel and Gretel are set for life.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, that Hansel sure can eat.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My corneas! You were saying?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eight kids. Hm, I'm sterile, right baby doll?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Beautiful.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Apu? Manjula? Marge, I've got a bad feeling about this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge... They've turned into jerks.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, Marge. No!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"She's no Liza, but it works.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't worry. I brought some chloroform.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,There... and... there...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, this is gettin' weird.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Please, Mr. Kidkill, look into your heart. I know these babies have a lifetime contract. But what if I put together an even better act for you? Something sensational!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not any more!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay... don't panic. Release the mongoose!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid mongoose! get the snake! The snake! Do I look like a snake? Ow! Ow! He bit me Show's over! Show's over! Next show is eight o'clock and ten!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What an age we live in.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I remember television!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nah. We'll go next month.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, look at this old-timey gizmo! I feel like I've gone back in a time machine.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What an age we live in.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no. You're not gettin' me on that dance floor. Don't try and make me. If I have to get a divorce I will.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's right, never!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh! I need a dance partner! What about you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo-hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's mine. Finally, I've won the respect of my fellow... Get away from it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Promise you won't laugh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know how.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Will you teach me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A gang! That's the answer.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Remember to rebel against authority, kids.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Quiet, Marge. The motorcycle and I are trying to sleep.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know, I know. Just tune her out.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, that's the life for me, Marge. Cruisin' and hasslin' shopkeepers.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, don't make me hassle you, Lisa.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, if you want to be in the gang, eventually you're gonna have to get motorcycles.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This gang's for rebels, Flanders, not conformos.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The first meeting of ""Hell's Satans"" is called to order.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm the president and the decision is mine. We're Hell's Satans. Besides, I've already made our club jackets.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Can't hassle us, pig. We're goin' the speed limit. Oink, oink, oink.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You can lock us away, but you'll never defeat the Cobras.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oink! Oink! Oink!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How could I be down a thousand bucks?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And what if we don't, Pops?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They printed my photo of our gang!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Carl looks great. Can't take a bad picture of that guy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,If you'd've been awake you would have said no. You can see the bind I was in.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're the Hell's Satans? What a fun coincidence. My gang's name is also the...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Done.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Caps and frisbees, sir.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And some pogs.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, police? Can you send a SWAT team to 742 Evergreen Ter...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But you have so much inner beauty.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're done. Next!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, bikers, that's it. Benjamin Franklin once said that house guests are like fish at... huh? They're gone! Woo hoo!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,... And those bikers saw that hard look in my eye -- you know that hard look I get sometimes? -- and they ran away like schoolgirls with their tails between their legs.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, someone really dropped the ball here. Marge? Marge?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really? Read it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that's sweet.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now don't worry. I am gonna search high and low for your mother. But just in case I don't find her, I want you to contact this agency.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I just don't want to be alone.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Excuse me, has anyone seen a woman wearing...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's more like it. I'm looking for...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll show you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, we kinda got off on the wrong foot there. Long story short, my ""old lady"" was...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, goodness. Mmm, some people never learn.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I guess I'll never find her.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No! My wife is not a doobie, to be passed around. I took a sacred vow on my wedding day, to bogart her forever.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You and me, chopper to chopper.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Never! It was a gift from Newsweek!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Give me back my wife!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whaddaya say, honey?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No dice!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Taking care of some unfinished business.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Go! Go! Go!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, why is this door locked?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's going on? And I want the non-gay explanation.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, thank God.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where are the refreshments?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maybe you should shut up.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Forget it. He releases the hounds on every charity that comes to his door: Feed the Children, Save the Whales, even Release the Hounds.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Get 'em, boy. Hit those smart-ass books.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uhh. Is this gonna be like one of those horror movies where we open the door and everything's normal, and we think you're crazy, but then there really is a killer robot and the next morning you find me impaled on a weather vane? Is that what this is, Lisa?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, who am I beating up?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, let's see. This will make three Christmases I saved versus eight I ruined... two were kind of a draw...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Writhing Funzos / In my sack / Makes me happy / Makes me hurt my back...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hah! If I had a nickel for every time I've heard that...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Please, Mr. Coleman. We can explain.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Perhaps, but let's not get bogged down in semantics.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think what Lisa meant to say is...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, it is Christmas. We'd better get home.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um, uh... Mr. Coleman, I've been thinking... My wife always makes too much stuffing and sweet p'taters and all, and... Aw, heck! Would you like to spend Christmas with us?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I like the ones where the mouse kills the cat.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get her! She's doing something!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Our junk!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And the exits are sealed! Go to plan B!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Come on!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh no you don't!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, precious heirlooms! Daddy would never let them take you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh. That was scary. We came this close to losing our spare Christmas tree stand. You monster.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Useless? This flash cube has two flashes left!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, let's go skiing right now!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where?!,,,,,

Homer Simpson,Stupid sexy Flanders!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ow, my legs! This is the worst pain ever...",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Come on, ""bikini inspector!"" ""Scrub toilet?"" Okay, that was a practice. Practice... Practice... Okay, here we go. ""Feed fish.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it's a great hat. No one's questioning the hat.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, I'll do the dishes when I pick it out of the chore hat, and it's not a practice. See, there it is. But that was a practice. The system works!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, eat, you lazy fish.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, but Lenny just got some bottle rockets.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's not true, he left it on the bus.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, help!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I got the groceries!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's the bread of astronauts.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah. You were way off.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, Lollipop Island? There's a little girl here who had too many sourballs.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Anyway, where were we? Hello? Hello? They hung up.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Use your brains to help us. Your delicious brains.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! You wonderful man!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart! Leave some for Rod and Todd!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here you go, lad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So you're shunning us.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,Howdy. And thanks for not recoiling in horror.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really? The whole beach?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Electric needle room?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I figured it out after I ate one of my chest sores.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This place is a blast. All we have to do is endure two hours of blinding pain, then it's nothin' but shopping and surfing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, loosen up. This is paradise.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Aloha / Aloha Until we meet a-,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bill, bill. Oooh! Llib! Eh-- Wait a minute. Bill?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Huh? Springfield University Homecoming! Finally, a chance to relive my golden college years...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Remember my love affair with Ali McGraw? She used to call me ""Preppy."" Then she died.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then the big game between Springfield U. and Springfield A & M. I hate Springfield U. so much.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So much.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"My old dorm room. Come on, baby, let's matriculate.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,Okay. All right. Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm beginning to think this alumni party was just a ruse to get our money.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Have you nerds forgotten everything I taught you? This calls for a prank. I see a bucket...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, this is gonna be so great.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So when Dean Peterson opens his door, this bucket of Super Glue is gonna drop right on his head...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,He-- What the?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,

Homer Simpson,What guys? I wanna see the freaks.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Easy... easy...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Too far.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What? I can see fine.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,I see the light! It burns!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, Miracle Boy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I believe I had hair. Oh, here they are.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't come up with an idea for my homecoming float. Do it for me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look at Moe dance! ALOHA MOE...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, you're right.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Go S.U.!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, well you went to a cow college!",,,,,

Homer Simpson,Or else what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, right. The ice pick.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, I need a miracle!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Please, Bart. You've gotta use your powers! I'm beggin' ya!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, do your thing!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Poor guy. He lost his leg.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This is my year, Marge. Everyone knows I'm what makes this city great.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wha...?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who are you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Everyone gets an award but me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, why won't anyone give me an award?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I mean an award that's worth winning.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What's that, sonny?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, that was a great night for us all.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nothing you can say will diminish this honor.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look at me, I'm a billionaire!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And the bed never needs to be made. Check it out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wasteful AND practical.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A mechanical dressing dealy! Watch this, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now I'm ready to hit the town.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm drunk!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look how loud I have to yell!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why, Marge, I believe you're supposed to scratch your ass with it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oops, forgot to swirl it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Jimmy is such an ugly word, Marge. Unless you're talking about Jimmy Smits.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen, I worked long and hard for this place. And no one's going to take it away from me. Not you, not its rightful owner, not anybody.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And another thing: If I ev...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Operator, get me Thailand. T...i... and so on.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Everybody. I found Burnsie's address book. I called the New York Yankees and told them to bunt, and then I called the Queen of England and asked her how it was going, and then I...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just a second, Marge. Hello! Thailand? How's everything on your end? Uh-huh. That's some language you got there. And you talk like that twenty-four seven, huh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Geez, way to burst my bubble, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you're right. We do have to have a party.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What about partays?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Damn!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I looked so good on that box.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Havin' a party, Moe. I'll need four kegs of your finest imported-sounding beer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mmmm, Danish.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Huh? If you can't sell beer, what are Lenny and Carl doing here?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I need that beer now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What's that, a theme park?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"They were so drunk. Gentlemen, get off your knees. Your rich uncle Homer is throwing the wildest box social the high seas have ever seen!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And you're invited.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you know I normally listen to you, but I've gotta seize this opportunity. Just in case I never become a real billionaire.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Propellers... SPINNING! Turn... LEFT! Boat go... THERE!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ships ahoy!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well done, Mr. Lenny. Well done.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We made it, son. International waters -- the land that law forgot.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's right. See that ship over there?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"They're rebroadcasting Major League Baseball with implied oral consent, not expressed written consent! Or so the legend goes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,There are no laws. We can do anything we want! Anything!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ow, ow! Oh, real mature, Lenny.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look at those poor saps back on land. With their laws and ethics. They'll never know the simple joys of a monkey knife fight.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, Bart. The Coast Guard is covering the Doobs!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who's the greatest billionaire in the world?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pirates! Are you friendly pirates?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What have you done with my party guests?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Third best for me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Help, pirates!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, bless you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that would be just... You're just yankin' my chain, aren't you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't wanna!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ah ha! Prepare to die!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You too.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Agh! Rope burns!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, oooh, Charlie horse, Charlie horse!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Agh, my mouth!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"In the net, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Shut up, Net Face.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I said shut up, Net Face!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ahhhh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That was my plan all along. Now relax and the currents will take us home.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"They're the greatest heroes of all. Hey, something's clawing at my leg. Okay, it stopped.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, Mr. Burns, pirates got your yacht.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't know. After living like a billionaire, this place is kind of a dump.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's right. Just because we're not rich, doesn't mean that we don't have... Oh, I can't even finish. I wanna be rich!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Like these guys. And look at all these rich people here. Not as rich as they should be of course. But still rich. All that big money. Look at all of these. Got all this money. I have lots of money. Oh look at all the other people. Oh, look at all the people who can buy and sell me. I should send a list of these names to the IRS. I'm takin' 'em all down. Oh, look at all the rich people. Oh, look at the rich...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't shush me, you rich bastards!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Good luck gettin' a horse to eat dog food.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Vietnam Veteran.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I.D.? Man, Charlie didn't ask for I.D. when I fought at La Choy and Chun King. I saw my best friend's head explode at Margaret Cho.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why should I? Did my country give me a parade? No, man! They spat at me and...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thanks. This closes the saddest chapter in American history.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's B.T.O.! They're Canada's answer to E.L.P. Their big hit was ""T.C.B."" That's how we talked in the '70s. We didn't have a moment to spare.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Takin' Care of Business!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No talking! No new crap! ""Takin' Care of Business!"" Now!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Get to the ""workin' overtime"" part!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Work out!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Play ""Ain't Seen Nothing Yet!""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What-everrr!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I stand by my disappointed groan.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, Lisa. It glows. Oooo.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"See, Marge? I told you they could deep-fry my shirt.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Anybody care what this guy thinks?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Tunnel!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But he'll bring us joy, Marge. Unlike all your silly gewgaws.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, your pro-mop, anti-horse agenda has been clear for some time. But don't worry, I have a way for Duncan to earn his keep.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mmm, that's terrific, Duncan. You're ten for ten. Now, let's look in the rulebook and see if horses can play in the NFL.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Pearls, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Racehorse, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, I learned everything I needed to know from ""The Horse Whisperer"". Step One: Seduce a lonely housewife.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ma'am.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now for the actual horse whispering.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"When the race starts, run really fast!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Champion horse, coming through!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Good horse. Here's one taco and you'll get another when you win.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, where do you get those metal dealies for his feet?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's with the attitude? I just want some dealies.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,He ran all the way here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You can do it, Duncan. I don't care if your odds are... Five million to one!?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That horse better win, or we're taking a trip to the glue factory and he won't get to come.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Cheer up, son. I thought you looked damn good out there. Oh, wait. You were number ""5""? Eew! You stin... Damn good.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, he's not gonna be intimidated anymore. We're gonna toughen him up -- give him a new badass attitude. All those other horses will be shaking in their horse dealies.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not anymore. Ladies, say hello to...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Possessions are fleeting.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! In your little faces!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man, I got more trophies than Wayne Gretzky and the Pope combined.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've been waiting all my life to hear that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, where'd you go?... Little man?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What happened?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What is this place?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why are you talking like that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But you're respected athletes! You own car dealerships and marry beauty queens.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What do you want me to do?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,MY HORSE MUST LOSE?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,AND WHAT IF I REFUSE TO LOSE?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,MY HORSE MUST LOSE!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Did that really happen? Or was it just a wonderful dream?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, don't ask why, but you have to lose the big race.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it is, it is. But we've been pushing that poor horse too hard.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, it is a good life, believe me... All right, we'll give it a shot. I'll deal with those murderous trolls.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I mean, I'll deal with those murderous trolls.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Go, son! Do it for the normals!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't stress enough how easy it was to win this prestigious race. And furthermore...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hollywood-is-leading-our-kids-down-a-moral-sewer-Gotta-go!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nah, we're cool.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, now!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, go get me a trash bag.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now that you're a champion, you'll have your pick of the fillies.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, she's the best. Ooo, can you imagine her face on her body?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But what if I have to do my business?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How come bears can crap in the woods and I can't?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bees!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, nobody panic. There's plenty of spray for me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No they didn't. They just surrounded it with something wonderful -- like a raisin covered in chocolate, or a monkey in a cowboy suit.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,See? Animals can get used to anything.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Better do what he says, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We can hike anytime. This is our chance to see cars driving.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Flanders? Since when do you like anything cool?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Be patient, son. A rushed car never crashes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I missed one!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Let's go! New tires! C'mon, c'mon!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, how rude of me. My name is...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My bad.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Finally!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I need a shirt! Gimme a shirt!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's a damn lie, and you know it! Gimme a shirt!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, T-shirt- T-shirt-T-shirt!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, a bobby pin.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And poor Ned didn't get a chance to say goodbye. Well, from now on I'm never gonna let you leave the room without telling you how much I love you and how truly special... this is really eating up a lot of time. Maybe just a pat on the butt. Yeah, that works.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I know. No more being a jerk.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Finally.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Quit hogging Flanders. I want to comfort him.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then I insist on walking you home.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Those feelings are normal, Ned. They're part of the process. Watch the sprinkler.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's natural to feel that way, but the sprinkler is gone. It's time to let go.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know, I know. It's never easy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You want anything else? Water? Chili fries? How about some white noise?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sleep tight, Neddie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What the... Oh, you want a rock fight, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, be right down.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yep, it would've been a lot better if you'd said ""I love you,"" or ""you're special."" You know, something sweet instead of that hot dog crack.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, now, now. Don't beat yourself up. I'm the one who drove her out of her seat. I'm the one who provoked the lethal barrage of t-shirts. I'm the one who parked in the ambulance zone preventing any possible resuscitation...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But, uh, there's no point in playing the blame game.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Easy answer, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah. That's it, baby, that's the money shot. Yeah, the camera loves you. Oh-ho-ho, you tease, you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You'll see...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think it's pretty obvious that I don't.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, from here we star-wipe to a glamour shot of Flanders paying his bills...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then we star-wipe to Flanders brushing his...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why eat hamburger when you can have steak?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, how're you doing, Ned?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, that's all gonna change, thanks to this tape...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, the audio needs some tweaking, and there's some footage of Maggie being born that I couldn't get rid of... Anyway, enjoy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Single women of Springfield, your prayers have been Flanswered.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ned Flanswered, that is.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shush.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What would you say about a man who owns his own house...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And his own car? That's Ned Flanders.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A man who's not afraid to cry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Ned.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ned does everything with class. Whether he's punching in his ATM code...or keeping clean in the shower...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But don't take my word for it. Listen to this testimonial.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So if you're tired of dating the same old losers...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...Step up to the best. Ned Flanders, the man with the chest.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, we'll just send this to the dating service, the chicks'll fall for you, and bam! The healing begins.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh-ho-ho-ho, that's great. Chicks really dig sensitivity. Did you get that, Bart?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Beautiful! And star-wipe, aaaand we're out.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hello? Mailman?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, wake up, Ned. You think Maude isn't dating in heaven?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"How could she not? The place is full of eligible bachelors -- John Wayne, Tupac Shakur, Sherlock Holmes...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,He sure is!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So how'd you do tonight, Romeo?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's right, Ned. Those floozies we married in Vegas were crazy about you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, we're trying to help Ned.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I toileth not on ye Sabbath, woman! A pox on thee.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I'm as surprised as you, but I've stumbled upon the most delicious British sit-com.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's about a hard-drinking, yet loving family of soccer hooligans. If they're not having a go with a bird, they're having a row with a wanker.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The Mother's the voice of reason.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what the hell's going on?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're mad? Where's my show!?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Finally.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why are you torturing me? I'm just a man.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, why didn't you say so?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, I'd like to pledge ten thousand dollars to get them to shut up. From... anonymous.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Done and done.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh, how're they gonna find me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, why did I register with Insta-trace?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh-oh. You've gotta help me, Bart.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's it, boy! Go get help!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay Homer, don't panic. Let me do the talking.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Umm... It's an honor to give ten thousand dollars, especially now, when the rich mosaic of cable programming has made public television so very, very unnecessary.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Will cash be okay?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, then we've got a problem. The banks are closed by now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Maybe your movie star banks are open crazy hours, but we in Springfield are simple folk. We like our cars fast, and our banks closed. Okay, fine, we'll go down there. But they're not going to be open.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, it's a real ghost town in there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'd like to withdraw ten thousand dollars, please.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll pay you later.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, why, no. Uh... Everything is just...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't do it. I can't kill a man!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mm-mm.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mm-hmm.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The Hooligans!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bingo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sanctuary!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sanctuary!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Quick! You've got to hide me from PBS! Their bloodthirsty pursuit is made possible by a grant from the Chubb Group!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Please help me! I'll do anything! I'll light a candle! I'll help with your next charity scam!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sure, sure, Bob's your uncle. Let's just get outta here!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Great, but why am I on a plane?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,South Pacific?! I didn't agree to...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wha -- Wait! I'm no missionary! I don't even believe in Jebus! Let me out!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, save me Jebus!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Jebus, where are you?! Homer to Jebus!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmm... This doesn't look so bad.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aww. Hi there, little fella.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're leaving? Wait, what do I do here?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Done.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Me Homer. Me hiding from PBS.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Here you go. Knock yourself out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Does the word ""jet-lag"" mean anything to you people? ""Jet-laggg"".",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yes. Very much so.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I'm good.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what happened to all the shirtless girls you see in all the geographical magazines?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What was that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Great. Now my testicle's got ants on it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, sweetheart. Have a Bible. My name's Homer. What's yours?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm gonna call you Lisa Junior. So, what do you do for fun around here?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Craig and Amy, Craig and Amy. Why don't you just marry Craig and Amy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, how's the TV reception here? Excellent, or...?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You don't have TV? But what will I watch while I'm sitting on the couch?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No couches either? Oh, man. I need a beer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nothin'.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Here we go. Ee-yeah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I guess so, but that first month was pretty rough.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Really? Without TV, it's hard to know when one day begins and the other ends.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mmm, I can see the house is falling apart without me, so here's the new order: Bart, you're the man of the house. Lisa -- I'm promoting you to boy. Maggie's now the brainy girl. The toaster can fill in for Maggie. And Marge, you're a consultant.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, boy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really? You're proud of me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, really? Well, if you'll excuse me, I've got some civilization to spread like butter on the English muffin that is these people, with all their little nooks and crannies...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm not not licking toads... Well, it's time to get to work. Humanitarian Homer Simpson, over and out.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Gather 'round, everyone! I'm going to teach you about religion.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Please, please, that's not necessary. I'm just God's messenger.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And lo, what a wondrous message it is:",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Like this, from the Book of P-salms: ""God will shatter the heads of his enemies, the hairy crown of those who walk in their guilty ways. That you may bathe your feet in blood."" As true today as it was when it was written.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, let's open it up to some Q & A.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, Lisa Junior?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, not the Unitarians. If that's the one true faith, I'll eat my hat.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, Ak, it's because God is powerful, but also insecure, like Barbra Streisand, before James Brolin. Oh, he's been a rock.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, who am I kidding? The truth is, I'm no missionary. I work in a nuclear power plant.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, the point is, I want to help, but you don't need a well, or a chapel, or an immunization center. What you need's a little razzle dazzle. Qtoktok, are you thinking what I'm thinking?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, that's great. Now let's get to work!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, if ""The Flintstones"" has taught us anything, it's that pelicans can be used to mix cement.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on little friend, make a wisecrack. You know, ""it's a living,"" that sort of thing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oopsie.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Friends -- when I came here one month ago, this seemed like a strange and frightening place. But now I've learned to love this island as my second...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A plane! Stop! Get me off this stinking rock!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Anyhoo, I'm about to share with you a modern-day miracle. Something that has revitalized cities from East St. Louis to Biloxi, Mississippi. The magic medicine of... casino gambling!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It could be you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Check it out. There's Island Blackjack, Island Craps, Island Texas Hold 'em... But if, like me, you're mesmerized by pretty colors and spinning things, you'll prefer roulette. Four sand dollars on number six, please.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, how you doin'? Stayin' out of trouble?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, over here I've brewed up my favorite beverage: beer. It's mostly Dristan and holy water, but it does the job.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So have fun everybody. And who knows? Maybe you'll hit the jackpot, get off this island, and spend the rest of your days in a tropical paradise.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you should've seen their faces, honey. Now I know how Bob Stupak feels.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is everybody happyyyyy?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, my God.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, what happened?! I gave you a glittering Vegas, and you turned it into a skanky Atlantic City!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Because you're all terrible sinners.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Since I got here. Now either grab a stone or go to Hell.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I may not know much about God, but I have to say, we built a pretty nice cage for Him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not bad, Lisa Junior. But God's palace is way up on the moon...so if we want Him to hear us, we've gotta crank up the volume.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Do you hear me, Lord?! Homer's doing your work! I'm the greatest missionary of all time! Of all time!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no! This looks like the end!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fire! Fire!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fire!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get in! Move it! This is not a drill!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good work, everyone. We're sure to be first in line for Duff Days.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I know. I'm a character. Now a little beer music to get in the mood.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Looking for these? Dee-dee-dee.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Twist off, dammit!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Go Moe! Boo everyone else!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ahhh, you can really taste the goat.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, guys. One, two, three.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moo?! Lenny, you were supposed to be ""E"".",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That one.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, Maggie wants a balloon and daddy will take a hand stamp so he can get back in.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just kidding. Remember my face.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe, the new Duff calendars are out! The ones with your picture!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Moe. There's lots of people uglier than you. Like, you ever been to White Castle?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Caveman brow...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, Moe. Don't feel bad. There's too much emphasis on looks these days. That's why they won't let Bill Maher on TV before midnight.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, it's time to get some closure. Extreme closure.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hurry, hurry up! I have to pee!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, now do Moe.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you dear, dear man. You're one of us beautiful people now. And your new life begins today.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Run!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're gonna get even with that lottery guy that never picks our numbers.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whatever.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Moe. Beer me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmm. This isn't nearly as complicated as Moe made it seem.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You don't love me. The only thing you love is your ear, nose and throat pavilion.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That was amazing, Moe. I'm actually a little turned on.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I know what you mean. Our dog had that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The one with the amulet?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What? Let me see that! ""Interior Coroner's Office. Close-up on Dr. Winslow's mangled corpse. Coroner: 'Let's get that brain out and weighed, and call it a day.'"" Yep, that does sound kinda bad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ding-dong!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dr. Winslooooow...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I am an angel from the future.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're going to die in a skydiving accident.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gabriella's baby shower will be invaded by terrorists. With sexy results.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, Sister Bernadette will leave the convent and start a softball team. With sexy results.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,...and only then do we find out that Professor Gallaway's half-sister is plotting to take over International Perfume and Wine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm sorry about your face, Moe.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, you were...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Let's see... Judging from the bug build-up, we're gettin' close.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right! Geez...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,God bless Native America.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Let's go, Marge. C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, what better place to celebrate your recovery than amidst the frenzied excitement of the casino floor? Lisa?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sure we can't talk you into it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, son. Although they seem strange to us, we must respect the ways of the Indian.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"HI-HOW-ARE-YA, HI-HOW-ARE-YA, HI-HOW-ARE-YA, HI-HOW-ARE-YA.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bleh. This virtual fudge tastes like crap.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, what a bleak, horrible future we live in!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Right, right, present. Anyway, can I get you some Soylent Green?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, here we go.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'm tired of giving you money. Why can't you be more like Lisa?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You should've thought of that before you dropped out of the DeVry Institute.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm still cool.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I do have this robotic prostate, but you can't see it. Oh, you can.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,She knows what time dinner is.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Searched for Lincoln's gold.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then what is his ghost protecting?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,... four score and four... four score and five... four score and six... four score and seven paces.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I started what from a what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Gold bars discovered by Marge? Zero. Gold bars discovered by Homer? Well, let's just see...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oops, sorry, honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shut up.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I did it! I found Lincoln's gold!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, crap!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That lying , rail-splitting , theater-going freak!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, trash night. In France, they call it ""La Nuit Des Poubelles."" In Germany, it's ""Crappenfest.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Quit gabbin' and start grabbin'. And remember, the best stuff is usually deep in the garbage juice.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,See? A new pacifier for Maggie.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Especially when we send it to him piece by piece.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Shh, quiet.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,Not a chance. I can sink way lower. I just came to help my friend Barney.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The sugar cookies you speak of. Are they real or symbolic?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't wanna walk that far. Anything that takes twelve steps isn't worth doing. Get it? Huh? Twelve? Steps.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey? How did I get out here?,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Hi, kids!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get off! Get off!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, I'm comin'.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,It's not bad.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,...And three makes three.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It'll be real soon enough.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, my first issue of ""Self-Test Monthly."" Finally I get to find out what makes me tick.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but in what ratio?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you a good driver?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Yes."" ""Are you a good lover?"" ""Yes."" Oh, I'm doin' great!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My way is easier.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Quizmaster, yes... That would entertain me briefly.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, Flanders, your love quiz score is 61. That makes you a ""Frigid Frieda."" I took off thirty points for all that crying you did.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No way. When?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah. I saw a gopher. What a day!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay. ""Last question: Who is your favorite Backstreet Boy?""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,According to this you're both idiots.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay. ""There's a black widow at your door, a rattlesnake at the window, and a scorpion on the phone. Do you A) None of the below, B)...""",,,,,

Homer Simpson,You see? Gibberish. All gibberish.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You gotta hide me. Death is after me! And I don't entirely trust these cowboys.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A mother can't die. And I'm a mother. See?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sometimes. But the guy I really hate is your father.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why isn't my baby gaining weight?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I see...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Florida? But that's America's wang.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My pockets hurt.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Par-ty!,,,,,

Homer Simpson,Par-ty! Par-ty! Par-ty!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, this is living!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wooo! I like mu-sic!,,,,,

Homer Simpson,Didn't you ever go to camp? The ol' Vitamin Barn...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look at you, all sugar and spice instead of equations and test tubes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're Daddy's precious dancing queen!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now honey, what were you trying to say before we kept interrupting you with our loving proudness?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh! What's that awful sound?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shh! This plot is hard enough to follow as it is.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, that pressure we put on her really paid off!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Go, Lisa! C'mon, everybody, give it up for my little girl!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I didn't think, I just acted.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What are you talking about, Professor Frink? They're clearly in the ""On"" position. See? ""On.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh. Ohhhhh. Well, now that I look even closer...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's not true, honey. You can always write a depressing Broadway play of some kind.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, yeah. You could load it up with lots of swears. That's what David Mamet does.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why? It's just a cute little weasel. Hello there, Mister weasel.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm down.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I didn't hit your precious table.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,Take your time!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Becky, I think I speak for all of us when I say ""When's the ice cream gonna get here?""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Run, Marge, run! Pump those crazy legs!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, she'll show up here sooner or later. To finish off Becky. Then we'll have Mommy back.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I heard she mates with men, then eats them.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, about that. Uh -- when I changed your oil, I may have drained your brake fluid. I didn't say anything 'cause I thought you'd be mad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You monsters! You've killed her!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thank you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Everybody wanted a piece of us.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Then we figured out we could park them in front of the TV. That's how I was raised, and I turned out TV.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Our favorite show was ""Hollywood Hogwash."" But we also loved ""The Dreck Squad""...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But we never saw people like us on TV.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""My Funny Family,"" take one.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Aannnd action!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Honey, I'm home! The boss is coming to dinner and I need a clean shirt.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mamma mia! Now I'll have to do it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not now. I'm busy turning on this washing machine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mamma mia!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Every day I thought about firing Marge. You know, just to shake things up.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,...M-E-R. Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're almost there.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Good.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, let's go out for frosty chocolate milkshakes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And that horrible act of child abuse became one of our most beloved running gags.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I want to set the record straight. I thought the cop was a prostitute.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, Mister Lobster.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Everything was goin' great at first. I felt like I was king of the world.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm king of the world! Woo hoo! Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Right about here, I realize something's wrong.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yep, there I go. Then came the rocks. Jagged rocks. Hitting me with their jags.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, my leg! This is the worst pain ever! Stop pummeling me! It's really painful! Owww!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why did I take such punishment? Let's just say that fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug was the drugs.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, they can't take our house. My pot-bellied pig is in there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ohhhh, Mister. Porky.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who told you about those laws? Was it Marge?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Helloooo, Iowa! Does anyone have a donut?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, something that rocks. That's the sound of today.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Rocks!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll kill you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, hey, stop it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who are you! I'll get you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That slugfest at the state fair was really a blessing. It gave us a chance to pursue solo projects. I returned to my first love, the legitimate theater.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"WHERE IS THE RENT? / I MUST HAVE THE RENT! / DOLLARS, DIMES AND NICKELS / I NEED THEM ALL RIGHT NOW!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I literally chewed the scenery.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's ridiculous! How could I even get all five necessary drops into her cereal?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, uh, how's everybody doing?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It was the best Thanksgiving ever. I mean, emotionally, it was terrible. But the turkey was so moist.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hi!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?! What's she doing here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, go on.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We put all the craziness behind us, and now it's time to get back to what matters: the show, and the Sunday comic strip.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The Simpsons are going to Delaware!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This'll be the last season.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, who cut out Beetle Bailey? I need my Miss Buxley fix.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh, too much baggage. Oo, my horoscope. Taurus: ""Today you will die.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,... and you may get a compliment from an attractive co-worker! Lenny?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooo, scary newspaper. Don't hurt me, horoscope. I'm afraid of...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ow! Oooh! Paper cut, paper cut!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Missed me! Stupid horoscope!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid horoscope!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cloopid blore-apope!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nah, he'll get tired of biting in an hour or so. Snakes: nature's quitters.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That horoscope was baloney. Nothing happened except for the pick ax in my head, the rattlesnake bite and the testicle thing. What's for dessert?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"St. Peter! Woo hoo! Got to heaven before you, Flanders!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, the thing about that is...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm sorry, I didn't get the number of hours or good deeds.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Let's see, good deed...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,... Gotta find a good deed.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bingo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Did you see that? I did the deed! Open up!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I thought you guys could see everything.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well I'll be damned.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I am Hooomer Siiimpsonnn...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh no!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, Wife! Hello, children!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who's up for a merry jig?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, who am I kidding? I'm not merry.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I lost my job as an oaf today.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whaddaya think? Do you love it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'm no dunce. I was born an oaf, and I'll die an oaf.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't worry. No child will ever starve in my home.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So long, kids. Enjoy your new home! Say hi to your other brother and sister.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, dumping your kids in the forest sure gets your hands dusty.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Here's a better idea -- I know how we can replace those children.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Son? Daughter? I'm ever so sorry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mmm, sugar walls.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, rescue you, stuff myself with candy... It's all good.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that's all you got? Huh? Huh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mmmm, fish. Oh no, that's me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Almost. Just give her another twenty minutes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Comin' up!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"... Two Krusty shakes, a donut burger with cheese and a party-size bucket of flan.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, I will have fries with that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Anything to get out of work.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Intelligent Italians? Something's wrong.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmm. Phone's off the hook. Everything must be okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It was her, all right. Take the one who wronged you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait, stop! We can outsmart those dolphins! Don't forget, we invented computers, leg warmers, bendy straws, peel n' eat shrimp, the glory hole, and the pudding cup. I'm not gonna let a few hoop-jumping tuna-munchers push me around!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, leave my daughter alone! C'mon, humans! We've wiped out entire species before. We can do it again!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,C'mon lads! Let's drive them back to the ocean!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you gotta hand it to those dolphins. They just wanted it more.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Television broken?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Badger, my ass. It's probably Milhouse.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Milhouse? Milhouse?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's a badger all right... Or possibly a griffin. Bart, do you have any dynamite in your room?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Great idea. Then we should call the doctor about this.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What am I, a tailor?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Area code? But it's a local call.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"939?! What the hell is that? Oh, my life is ruined.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, if only it were that easy, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Go away. We've got bigger problems now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm not gonna stand for this. I'm gonna call the newspapers, the TV stations, the gas stations, everybody.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I hate this new area code. Like I don't have enough to remember already.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't you miss the old 636, Carl?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What really burns me up is they didn't give us one word of warning.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not a single word of warning.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Joan Collins? That girl sleeps with everybody!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The Who? I love bands!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's my number!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, that's not me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's not fair! I've been a fan of the Who since the very beginning, when they were the Hillbilly Bugger Boys.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Good idea.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How the hell did they find that out?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, I have a question, Phoney.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Quiet, honey. Daddy's asking the man a question.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute! We haven't heard from me yet. The nut with the dynamite. The phone company is bamboozling you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I accuse the phone company of making that film on purpose!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, I'm not one to make trouble... but it seems to me that everyone who got to keep the old, or ""classic"" 636 area code, lives on... the rich side of town!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And as usual, we Joe Twelve-Packs get the royal screw job.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I've had it! You rich snobs aren't pushin' us around anymore!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nice wiring, Bart.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, Plan B. Fellow 9-3-9'ers, I say we break off and form our own city!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now who's stupid?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,There. We're officially a city. Now we just sit back and wait for an NFL franchise.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Keep walkin',,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mayor, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I reluctantly accept this highly-paid, glamorous job.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,New Springfield rocks!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah? What is it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Damnit!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Read my lips: Yes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No problem.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stop right there.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sweetie, you know your mother and I only stay together for the sake of my political career.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Big grins!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That'll play great in the sticks.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that was fifty already?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, the TV man is talking about us!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah? They think they're better than us, huh? Bart, c'mere a minute.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thank you, Marge. Now, let's see how Olde Snobfield does without electricity.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Those rich, snobby Indians.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Flood from water!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're right. We've got to block them from our sight with a giant wall.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Good idea. We should call the guys they used.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's ringing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I'd like to thank Low Ball Construction for building this amazing wall... From ninety percent recycled materials.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Loyal citizens of New Springfield. You stayed on my side of town despite a total lack of hospitals and schools, and a sewage nightmare that threatens to consume us all.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, we have plenty of supplies to get through tomorrow. And then a wave of disease should help to -- hey!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stop streaming over the wall! At least wait till I'm through talking.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, now as for food, the following breeds of dog are edible...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't believe all those rats fled my town.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Guess it's just us and the tumbleweeds.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't believe those traitors abandoned us. They couldn't take one lousy famine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No problem.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Anyhow, those rats'll come crawling back...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We've got the Who playing here tonight.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, maybe we could. But we'll need some liquid persuasion.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, Bart. We're gonna bring back The Who.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Huh? Oh, right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll give you this bottle of chloroform if you'll take us to The Who.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, The Who!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo! Rock 'n' roll!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whatever. The point is, I'm Homer Simpson.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's right.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's right. And I implore you to move your concert to our town. Don't play Olde Springfield, or as it is sometimes known, Sun City.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, what happened to the angry, defiant Who of ""My Generation,"" ""Won't Get Fooled Again,"" and ""Mama's Got a Squeeze Box""?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But those Olde Springfield squares are just gonna make you cut your hair, turn down your music and wear frilly shirts like Keith Partridge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Somethin' wrong with your legs?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, don't worry. They'll be here soon. And then they'll see who's got the better town.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now these are the tunes I want you boys to play.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, c'mon, it plays itself. ""Pacman Fever / A do do do do / It's driving me crazy."" Look Lisa, Daddy's in the Who!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, New Springfield's lookin' pretty good now, isn't it? With our ample parking and daily Who concerts.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We'll talk.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ha-ha. You hit the tire fire! You'll have to do...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Magic Bus!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pinball Wizard!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well Marge, looks like your insane experiment is over.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This watermelon won't know what hit it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, we're heroes... But where's our parade?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right. ""Open stuck drawer..."" All-righty.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh, it's hopeless.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, it's hopeless.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I said, it's... Ohhh...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen, do you want the job done right or do you want it done fast?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, don't worry. You'll be sleeping in this beautiful new doghouse. Target date: January, 2007.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And now, the grand finale... ""Get Lisa's jammed tape out of VCR.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oop, wait a minute...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,There.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fire in the hole!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmm. It's gonna take a lot of fireworks to clean this place up.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, honey, there's a point in every father's life when he blows up his daughter's room.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Lisa, this must be a rough time for you. Do you have any friends or family you can stay with?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, come on. Tell us how we can make it up to you. Hey, pretend it's your birthday.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Anything at all. You name it. What do you want to do?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid Lisa.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,A walk? That's a really good idea.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't understand. That wasn't funny.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,Is there no place for the man with a 105 IQ?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm a Spaulding Gray in a Rick Dees world. Change me back to the blissful boob I was!,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Well, there's a dull ache, certainly. And overlaid on that is a club sandwich of pain. Only instead of bacon, there's agony. Marge, can I have a BLT?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What are you looking at?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"First I'd feel like having a BLT, then proud of you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My back!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So? Just gimme some drugs and surgery.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Patent pending... Patent pending... Patent pending... Hey, who's this guy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You brought a convict to live here, near my unpatented idea?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmm. I don't know what that is, so I'm gonna say yes. Now, go limp.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Next!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, talk about irony. The AMA tries to drive you guys out of business. Now you're doing the same to me. Think about the irony...",,,,,

Homer Simpson,What funny names.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That thing got picture-in-picture?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, geez. How come they never call traveling anymore?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whoa, whoa, this is gettin' kind of pricey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mr. Salesman?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We're gonna go with the wolves.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,What on Earth are you doing?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's tennis?! Then what's the one where the chicks whale on each other?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes! That's what I wanted!,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Ohhh, well that's bad news for Dingbat Charlie. He's gonna be crushed.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, now some of that is me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, honey. I can see this means a lot to you. I'll practice till my elbow is swollen and discolored.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good news, honey. I found a way to prove to the town we're not losers. I've entered us in a doubles tournament.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,Uh-oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't think they saw me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, Bart. How are the tennis partners?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't touch me. Your hands feel like salad tongs.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My manhood? I never thought of that!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't care about B.C., I care about M.E. My enjoyment.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's obvious what's happening. I'm being replaced by a younger, more in-your-face version of me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maybe five bucks would refresh my memory.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who pays for that wedding?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're right. But just to be safe, maybe I should chain him up.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think you're underreacting.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This session's under.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Badbye.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No. No. Stay away from my wife, Bart.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's the guy! That's the guy from my dream!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Go ahead and smile, smart guy. I'm gonna mop you up like turkey gravy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Absolutely, sweetie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, of course not. Now aim for your mother's heart.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Hey, leave my teammate alone!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Babies.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't listen. It's a trick!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think he's trying to psych you out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, look who's here. You two are goin' down.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Did you hear that? She said we're goin' down!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that's loser talk!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Unbeatable, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Comin' through... Hey, hi Otto... Sorry...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, that's great. Listen, I need a new doubles partner. My little girl's a lead weight.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but only to crush my wife and son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hm, you seem less disgusted. Let's go!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Booo! You rot!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Up- bup...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now Lisa, dumping is such a harsh word. Let's just say I'm replacing you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, swing. Run. Hit the thing. Now run across the...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Everybody's been dumped but me. I'm undumpable.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My tennis stick!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who are you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Which one am I? Serena or Venus?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're a girl.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, there's a lesson here for all of us: it's better to watch stuff than to do stuff.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Courtesy of Pete Sampras.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sucker.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Y'ello!... Hey, Moe. We're watching you on TV.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, how's that bowel obstruction doing?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, it all starts when the nulecule comes out of its nest...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A world without Krusty -- what would that be like?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's on TV?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah, uh, I was at the flower shop today, too. Yup, gettin' drunk at the ol' flower shop.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Take it off!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Go. Blow.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"38! That's roughly my age! Marge, after a lot of thought, I've decided to run the Springfield marathon.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stay out of this, Lisa. Marge, I've made up my mind. I'll do your job for a day, and you do mine. Then we'll see who has it tougher.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Let's see. Sweatbands... check. Anti-chafing nipple tape... Check, check... and check.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I can't believe it! I'm actually running a marathon! Oh, I hit the wall! This is so painful! Hey, I got my second wind. Another wall! I ju-- Woo hoo! Third wind!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And thank you for assuming we're hip.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, now here's the 411: I'm a record producer, see. I'm starting a new boy band and there's a place in it for Bart.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And my dream is to get rid of Bart.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How many lives must you ruin?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Will you two shut up? I'm missing precious VJ prattle.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,YVAN EHT NIOJ. Ya gotta love that crazy chorus.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, it doesn't mean anything. It's like ""rama-lama ding dong"" or ""give peace a chance"".",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute, Bart's band is brainwashing kids with subliminal messages? That's pretty farfetched, Lisa.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Here comes the jealousy bug. Gonna git ya! Gonna git ya!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I wanna go home now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, ah, what songs did I miss?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, that's the look.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not ""MAD""! That's our nation's largest mental illness-themed humor magazine.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,'Bout time.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Smelson! It's funny 'cause you smell.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Am I ever!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Kids... How would you... like to go to... Blockoland?!!,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Maggie, no!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We're here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I am a robot. Do what I say.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I am a washing machine. Do what I say.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Check it out. I built myself a healthy apple.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yep, a shiny new apple.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I get it. Everything's made of blocks. Even the water.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What are you gonna do about it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Leeches!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Welcome to real life, Lisa. You can't fight city hall, AKA Blockoland. So don't even try.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's what I always tell them. I told them that twice yesterday. And then again as they were going to sleep.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're right, honey. Hear that, kids? The Simpsons are going to Blockoland!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,'Scuse me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You sold my little girl a shoddy Eiffel Tower.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, you're right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But before I go, I'm gonna give you a little souvenir of my own.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, any friend of Marge is a friend of mine.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, how's that new block I got you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, standing up for the little guy felt good. I'm gonna do it more often.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Those bullies are gone now!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"My heart was in the right place, jerk!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, you're welcome, honey. Now, I'm gonna spend the whole day helping shmoes with their problems. Got a problem, Bart?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, son. I'll handle this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Come on! Why won't you go out with Bart?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Please, ugly is such a smelly word. Who would you rather go out with?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well duh! He's breathtaking, but Bart has inner beauty... like you'd find in a rodent.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And face it, you're no prize either. You wear braces, you dress like a kid and you're not gettin' any younger. Take what you can get.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"They wouldn't? Well I'll go to bat for you, honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nice place you got here. Ooh look, a hair net. Be a shame if it was hurled to the ground!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, how clumsy of me? And...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oops!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Either you honor my wife's coupon, or a lot more lids will be unscrewed.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, really...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, you weren't kidding. Your profit margins are razor-thin.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute. Four hundred a month for loafer lightener?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You get the same results with a mincing gel.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The satisfaction of helping another human being is all the thanks I et cetera.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And I gave that man directions, even though I didn't know the way. 'Cause that's the kind of guy I am this week.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Say no more. I'll help you, Lenny.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm trying to get a refund for this ticket. Is this the executive office of the ball club?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, is that it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I see.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm sorry to hear that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, sir.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay. So, uh, you wanna go get something to eat?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Albuquerque Isotopes? What is all this stuff?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What a crazy room. There's no Albuquerque Isotopes. It's the Springfield... Ohhhh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're moving the team to Albuquerque, aren't you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, okay. But you can't silence Homer Simpson. I'm the friend of the downtrodden. And I'm not gonna forget what I saw here today.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute. Will this erase my memory?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, my head. How long have I been out here?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I was? But I love the swing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know me. Occasionally, I'll be quirky. ""I'll be quirky..."" Albuquerque! I'll be right back!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Members of the media...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,...thank you for coming. The proof that the Isotopes are moving to Albuquerque is right behind this door.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, that is an important story. But so is this!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't mind being called a liar when I'm lying, or about to lie, or just finished lying. But not when I'm telling the truth.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's it! I'll go on a hunger strike.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So? I can stop. And I will stop. I'm on a hunger strike, starting right... now!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let's see those double A baseball honchos ignore this.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"My hunger strike will not end until Duff admits they're moving the team. Bart, my chains.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now it begins.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man, he really hates Wayne Rogers.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't worry. Duff's not gonna let me waste away to nothing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey kid and man!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't support a team run by liars!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,They're secretly planning to move to Albuquerque.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, so hungry... Can't give up... Must continue fighting evil corporation.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nice try, God.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But Homer Simpson doesn't give in to temptation that easily... Hey!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stop that!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,DANCIN' AWAY MY HUNGER PANGS / MOVIN' MY FEET SO MY STOMACH WON'T HURT / I'M KINDA LIKE JESUS / BUT NOT IN A SACRILEGIOUS WAY...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm soooo hungry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's going on? What am I doin' here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?! That's not why I'm here!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,They're moving the team to Albuquerque!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All this hunger for nothin'.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do they have to chew so loud?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'm wasting away. I'm down to a B-cup.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'm so hungry. Oh, why keep starving myself? No one cares.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who are you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why do you look like Cesar Romero?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why are you here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I wanna!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's happening? Did I crush your corporation?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Me so hungee.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So hard to resist. Mesquite-grilled onions... jalapeÃ±o relish... Wait a minute, those are Southwestern ingredients!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mango-lime salsa?! That's the kind of bold flavor they enjoy in... Albuquerque!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Tell the truth! C'mon, everybody!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't listen to him, Duffman. For once in your life, stand up for the little guy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The truth never tasted so good!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What can you do? Sex sells.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"They said if I come in late again, I'm fired. I can't take that chance.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Kids gone?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You read my mind. Sooo...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This coffee's good, huh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, I think our marriage is...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I got it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I do!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, now. Put...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You...you really scared us.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's a pretty big caboose for a baby.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Noooo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is such an eye-opener. I always pictured the kids dying in the living room.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Three dollars? That doesn't seem so bad.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mm hm. Hmmmm.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We don't need your high-priced safety junk!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thank you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now don't feel bad, honey. Did you know back in grade school, I had a bully problem myself?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,EVERYBODY WAS KUNG-FU FIGHTING...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,THOSE CATS WERE FAST AS LIGHTNING...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Good times.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That baby-proofing crook wanted to sell us safety covers for the electrical outlets.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I'll just draw bunny faces on them to scare Maggie away.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,She will be.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"See, honey, Daddy's protecting you from all the sharp scary things. Here, hold this a sec.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ow! Oh, my...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay Maggie, put it down.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Down.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh. Okay, that's quite enough, it's not funny anymore.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now do you realize how unsafe the American home is? Baby accidents occur every three minutes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but this is me talking. Look, I already encased the telephone in concrete.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Reach into these holes. I use a carrot.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Baby could order poison.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Of course you are. Marge, I've finally discovered the reason God made me: to protect his tiniest, most breakable creatures. And I've got to share that gift with the world.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get her outta here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Savin' those babies. And the soft spots on their heads do, do, do, do do...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Problem: a pointy deity. And I've got the perfect solution.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, you know down the line, you might want to switch to a nice round Buddha.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So am I, but I don't get all huffy about it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Canceled.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's me! Safety dance!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,YOU CAN DANCE / YOU CAN DANCE / EVERYBODY LOOK AT YOUR PANTS.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dear God, what have I done?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Babies of Springfield! We need your help! Please! Skin your knees! Put dice up your nose! Let cats sleep on your face!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Simpsons rule! Sorry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So all her bullying was just to get some attention.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just to get some attention.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pound that nerd.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Olive oil?"" ""Asparagus?"" If your mother wasn't so fancy, we could shop at the gas station like normal people.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, okay, but get five bags in case we eat four on the way home.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,In the cart.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cart.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"My doctor says, and my garage mechanic agrees, that...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Y'know, I always felt sorry for Marge, having to do the shopping, but this is kind of fun.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait, I changed my mind.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stack it in the order I'll eat it driving home.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The customer's always right. That's what everybody likes about us. Now mush!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hurry up. I can't stand here jabbing you all day.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No you don't...,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Oh, the bag boys are on strike! I'm shaking.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,If I can have this rubber stick.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So hungry... There's gotta be some food left. Sulfur jerky... Cream of toast... Where did we get all this crap?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Good boy. Good boy. Show us where the food is.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where? Over there?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yoink.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,Africa? They're bound to have food there!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And on my free African safari, I want to do everything on this box.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I want to shoot a lion in the face, fight Muhammad Ali, and ride in a convertible with two happy zebras.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Your box made promises of a vacational nature. And I expect you to live up to them.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow! My eye!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, mister?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"On the plane, I'm gonna need two seats... for the twins.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The Simpsons are going to Africa!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just like Jimmy Carter.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's okay. I got 'em.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh, bound to happen.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wowww... It just rolled over to ten thousand.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"I've got more bones than that guy. If you're trying to impress me, you've failed.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You have failed.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"By the way, what kind of blood is this?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, it's like the Allman Brothers!",,,,,

Homer Simpson,It knows you're afraid.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, aren't they sweet. Any medical things I should know about?",,,,,

Homer Simpson,Uh... For frosty chocolate milkshakes. Frosty chocolate milkshakes!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll tell you where we're not going: jail.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why did you rat me out, kids? Was it because I showered love on those other children while ignoring you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I learned my lesson. From now on you two are the only kids I'll care about. Oh, and Maggie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now let's all enjoy the snack table while we still have it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, that'll happen.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Teamsters.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The Simpsons are going to Delaware!,,,,,

Homer Simpson,Stupid anti-fist-shaking laws.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The Simpsons are ridin' the rails!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What are you gonna do to us?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man, buffalo are easy to kill.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, but your next story better be worth it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, this'll be good.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whoopsie.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A poor delicious buffalo. He'll be dinner for the whole wagon train.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I haven't had buffalo in six hours. Marge, how 'bout whipping up some buffalo sausage, huevos buffaleros, and some fresh-squeezed buffal-O.J.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What have I done? What have I done?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Aww...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Big deal.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I liked that story 'cause I was a Judge.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll meet you in Wilmington.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Raise your arm... Okay, the other one...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it shows. I was gonna say something, but I thought it might sound you know, weird.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ew!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And it's important to feel good about yourself... Okay, spread your toes. Do you know how much glass is in here?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, Ethnictown. Where hard-working immigrants dream of becoming lazy, overfed Americans.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait, this is just a shaved puppy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The perfect crime. Marge, I have to be in court next Tuesday.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A fortune teller? Oh, no you don't. This phony gypsy just wants to rip you off. See, this wart is a fake!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So much for the legendary gypsy hospitality.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Beads!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Owww!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, that's me. And that's you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What-ever.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you coming on to me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Good as new.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I... There. Right as rain, there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, that ""curse"" is just a lot of silly superstition. Right Lisa?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Guys, I am not cursed!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Moe, they're dead! And it's all my fault!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,When did that happen?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let's make sure he's a leprechaun. Sing us a song of the Emerald Isle.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, 'tis like the singin' of the angels themselves.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Well, me saying I'm sorry won't bring him back.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,She's not the boss of me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mm, various eggs.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Trusting every aspect of our lives to a giant computer was the smartest thing we ever did!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I agree.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, that's the price of success.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's my blood alcohol?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Keep 'em comin'.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, she's cool.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lucky, shmucky. I knocked her up. But she's stuck now -- we're married, till death do us part. But if I died, she'd be completely free. For man or machine.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yep, a machine.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mm, unexplained bacon.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Good ol' table.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yep. Man one, machine zero. How do you like that score?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Die, you monster!",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, yeah, these kids are pretty special...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My sweet little angel!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, we stayed for your kids!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"WON'T YOU MARRY ME, BI-ILL? / I GOT THE WEDDING GOWN BI-ILL / 'CAUSE WEDDINGS ARE NI-ICE...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Didja hear that, Pengy? Forty dollars!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"End of the line, boys.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I love our court days.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Judge Snyder? While we're young?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll bring the car around.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What'd she say about cupcakes?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, your Honor, I was chasing the KBBL Party Penguin Prize Patrol.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And a Blue Oyster Cult medallion.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Coooool.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Your Honor, if I may sing a little bit of ""Don't Fear the Reaper"", I think you'll agree that...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I couldn't agree more. Perhaps some sort of court-appointed baby-sitter or au pair.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It won't?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Tethered?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Room five?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's a little tight.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I used to be.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, this punishment is so cruel.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,Cobras! Cobras!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow! Ow! Ow! Oh! Ah! Ow! Ow! Owww! That really hurt.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I thought I would hate working nights. But it's so peaceful. And there's no one here to squeal on me for shootin' mice.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sure, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, son. You know that's none of your business. Say, is that our house?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah... I forget things sometimes...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really. You like skateboards? We're sure learning a lot about each other.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ow, my head... Oh. I need a beer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I hit my head, Moe.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Since when?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, all right. Come on, Bart.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,It's about time. Oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, that's a pretty big ""if,"" honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I just got comfortable. Use the bottle.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine. I don't even know why we have a bottle. Somebody tell me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, son, it's a little chilly. Maybe you should wrap a blanket around your head.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's the big deal? He sees a thousand times worse on that animal channel.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why not? Kids are very visual these days.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, shut up.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Heyyy, how 'bout that? Ha, ha.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But, Constance, it only happened because...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait. I'm to blame, Judge. You see, I was pressuring my wife to make love in front of our son... you're gonna laugh when you hear this... when suddenly...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I admit it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Your Honor, I'd like to be tried separately.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dammit!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, that explains the sign.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, we could get out of these stupid things if you'd just tell the judge you're a bad mother. And you don't even have to say ""bad."" It could be ""negligent"" or ""unfit"" or ""drugged-up.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're right. It's time to stand up to that firm-breasted judge.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Easy... easy...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Shhh, you'll wake up Flanders...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Marge, surf's up!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, we tried all those other tools.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"She lives in a houseboat? Wow, she is so cool.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know, I know. Fight the power.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cops!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look at her in there, washing her body...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I hate to call a judge dirty names, but there's only one way to describe a nasty super witch like her.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it's just a friendly seal.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shut-uuuup...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Lord, guide this cinder block...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, how ya doin'?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So... it cost you nothin'.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That was close.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just the radio, dear.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The bridge column. Oh, that South. You never know what he'll do next. Hm... Aw. Look at that dad in ""Drabble."" He's like an unfunny version of me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Probably digging for drugs.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, Marge. I'll find out what he's up to. Kids shouldn't have secrets.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh hello, young man. Beautiful day for digging, isn't it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, uh, digging for anything in particular?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, I guess you wouldn't mind if I was to dig a hole of my own.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maybe I will.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Very little.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm having chest pains!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where's the defibrillator?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Clear!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This thing pays for itself.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes. Eventually, I became King of the Morlocks.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You callin' me a liar, Carl?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I just naturally assumed.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Geez Moe, you've been a real crank lately.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, ya see, that's what I'm talkin' about. You're always pointing that shotgun at us.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maybe we'd tip you if you'd smile once in a while.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That was an amazing throw.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, where'd that painting come from?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, ooh, pick me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can do. Now don't you worry about a thing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No Moe. You've got it all wrong. People buy beer from you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I thought you said you had to go.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man, when's the last time Moe cleaned this?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I don't know. What would Moe say about that?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But on the other hand, Moe's not here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,For what? A little splattered food never hurt anybody. Now everybody shut up and dance!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't worry. You gotta hit it just right. Like Fonzie.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ayyy!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh! Whoa! Hemorrhage-amundo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ayyy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yello?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooo, Bart! My first prank call. What do I do?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't get it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's the gag?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'M A WALKIN' DOWN THE STREET, GONNA OPEN MOE'S BAR / I'M A SINGIN' WHAT I'M THINKIN' / HEY, LOOK AT THAT DOG.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Teenage vandals smashing the bar! Moe's gonna kill me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You dirty teen.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Moe? Wrecking Moe's bar?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, well I I almost fainted, but then I didn't. What are you doing?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And it would look pretty, too.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hi, Formico.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry. He seems nice.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's not fair. Just when I was getting to be the world's greatest bartender, it's all snatched away.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Freshen your drink, pal?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There you go, doll.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, buddy, I don't care where you go, but you can't sleep here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, It looks like an alien headquarters. Couldn't you just see aliens runnin' out of there? Couldn't ya? Hey, wait up.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not for friends of Moe's.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't you know who I am?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cecil is a girl's name.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Um... the rabbits are cute.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, whatever. Just give me a Duff.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, whatever. Just give me a Duff.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, look cool.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm gonna tell Moe exactly what I think of his...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Oh, so you're ashamed of us. Well, you've turned into a big phony.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll throw myself out, thank you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I believe I had a hat.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Suckers!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think it's pretty obvious. I'm turning our garage into a tavern. The kind Moe's used to be.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's not about spite. It's about petty revenge and getting back at that traitor Moe. Now help me nail up this urinal.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Beautiful.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But when I'm passionate about something, I see it through to the end.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,'CAUSE MOE'S A BIG JERK AND A SHE-MALE TOO!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Barkeep!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's the family bar. Right, kids?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,As soon as you finish cutting up those lemons.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"She's so sleepy, she doesn't know what she's saying. Hee, hee.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We're rockin' great!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I told them it was a benefit. They think they're saving the rainforest.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Seems to me I already did.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bar? I see no bar. This is a hunting club...Which is permitted by state law ""to serve beverages of a refreshing nature.""",,,,,

Homer Simpson,I would.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here, turkey, turkey... Turkey, turkey, turkey, turkey, turkey...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nobody's gonna kill you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right turkey. Where are you? Turkeys, the only animal smarter than man.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the hell is that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A turkey!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A cougar! Die, cougar!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Got that cat right in the leg.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no! This time I really am gonna faint!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Son of a...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm sorry I shot you, Moe.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, who invited the hippies?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, I'm sorry... but I will not save the rainforest.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And I'm thankful I get to spend Thanksgiving with my family, these alternative rockers, and my favorite bartender.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And here you go.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah. And now to read my fortune. ""Geese can be troublesome."" What the hell is that supposed to mean?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I knew that before I came in here. A guy outside told me that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, these fortunes are terrible.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"These fortunes are terrible. They're supposed to predict stuff, and ease you through times of doubt and sickness.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Easy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You will be aroused by a shampoo commercial.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, let's see... ""The price of stamps will climb ever higher.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Let's see. ""You will invent a humorous toilet lid."" ""You will find true love on Flag Day."" ""Your store is being robbed, Apu."" Are you getting all this, Lisa?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stop that dog! It has my gum!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, Mr. Burns.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ummm...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh! Yeah. Monty's a wild man! Yeah!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh. He ran his own casino, stole the Loch Ness Monster, got shot by a baby, and blotted out the sun.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, he's a total player.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Windowsill.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Burns wants me to come along on his date, to show him where hip young people go.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're right.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,These would stop Joan Collins herself.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yep, no one's rowdier and more youthful than old man Burns.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, Mr. Burns.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, sorry.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No problem.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But Mr. Burns, you're exhausted.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can I have some ice cream? I finished my pizza.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're going to ask her to marry you?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you sure you wanna do this so fast?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let go of her or I'll scream!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, this is my house. Ah--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ohh... Geez, I just wanted to escape.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pistol whip?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmm... pistol whip.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, who do you have to kill to get a place like this?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You know what would be surprising? A foot massage.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um, has the ship sailed on my foot massage suggestion?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmm...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Good fire. Good fire. Keep burning. Almost there.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just a little more.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, Mr. Burns, how did you do that?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What about the wiener? A guy on TV lifted a can of paint with his.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I know.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You mean a Van Dyke?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, a bee almost stung me today. I felt the wind go right by my ear.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooo, that's quite a hug, honey...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you're looking at that spokes-jack! Well I can fantasize too.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooo, Mama Celeste.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Love? ""Signed photo""?! Marge hasn't asked me for a signed photo in months! Well I'll show her!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello. This is Chad Sexington, the model for Burly Paper Towels.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know. But I was quite moved by your letter. I'd love to meet you and your family. Shall we say dinner?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Perfect. I'll be there at seven.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I was having a private conversation with my wife, in the guise of Chad Sexington. Do you mind?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, how was your day? Did anything unbelievable happen? Phone calls, things of that nature?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Tonight? Well, you better get your hopes up.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's him.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why look, it's Chad Sexington!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It was hard on me, too. I had to wear a suit. Oh, you're right. I've gotta make it up to her.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"How about Benihana, where dinner is the show?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, huh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, nothing is hurt except feelings.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Zing! What's a Skeletor?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do me! Do me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I am in your power. Boss me around.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look at me, I'm a famous historian! Out of my way!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look at me, I'm Angie Dickinson! Out of my way!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm twelve years old... I'm with my friends. It's a beautiful summer day at the old swimming hole... Oh my God!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that's better...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Here you go.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?... There have been so many classic Simpson moments. I remember that time I tried to jump over Springfield gorge...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hm, twelve... Well, I remember I used to go hiking a lot with these two guys. With these two guys.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It was one of those lazy summer days you thought would last forever. And to kill the boredom, we sang.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute. I remember falling in the mud, but I don't think that's why I've been screaming...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Something else happened in that quarry... something... else...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey come on...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's responsible for everything wrong in my life -- my occasional overeating, my fear of corpses...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, hey, you guys can come with us.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bye, Moe.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yep, the old quarry is just a stone's throw away.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Never!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is it. This is the old quarry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Someone's yellow belly is showing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And it's empty. Put it back! I don't wanna see it this way.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And someone has eaten the flesh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now do you believe dead rats float, Lisa?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, a movie! I call the couch!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now the movie's turned into a play! Still good, though.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well Marge, we solved the case of the haunted quarry.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why? He'd just bury it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Seems kinda pointless now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Did you really make that envelope? 'Cause it says Hammermill over here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"WHEN YOU HAVE A RIB-EYE STEAK / YOU MUST FLOSS IT / OH, THAT MEATLOAF TASTED GREAT / YOU MUST FLOSS IT / NOW FLOSS IT, FLOSS IT GOOD.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just a second, son. I've gotta put on my contacts.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Science!?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mmmm, pie pants.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This is Launch Master Homer, counting down. Five, four, three...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Two... one...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The word ""unblowupable"" is thrown around a lot these days, but I think I can say with confidence...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, that shows you what could potentially happen.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What was that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I have eyes, don't I?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I would really like to thank you nerds for helping me out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dweeb, wonk, spaz... it's all good.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Super. Now if you'll gather around, I'd like to say a few words. All nerds clear the launch area.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now all we need is our astronaut. Bart, where's America's newest hero?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, we are about to break the surly bonds of gravity and punch the face of God.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Five, four, three, two, one... COUNTDOWN!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay Nibbles, you can guide her down. Step one: Right in front of you is a blue handle. Pull for a controlled burn of two point four seconds...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, I planned for this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You say that so much it's lost all meaning.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,'Cause he's all man.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Quiet, Lisa. Everyone in the store is looking at you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know how to feel.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Got it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How was that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, you think you know better than this family, huh. Well, as long as you're in my house, you'll do what I do and believe what I believe. So butter your bacon!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hold that thought. Bacon up that sausage, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wha?! That's it. No more chat rooms for you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think this tree could use an angel.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's go time.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know what Santa left you. I just know his name is Clip-Clop and he loves sugar.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bag's in the kitchen.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I did it. I found our dog. Now our Christmas is complete.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So you're back on the winning team?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's all I ever asked.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A grizzly bear with a chainsaw. Now there's a killing machine!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No problem. There's plenty of activities inside.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The TV!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Quit trying to control me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,New shooter.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, we'll see about that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"One, two, three.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm good for the rest, you know I am.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They told me it would be like this on the outside.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Police brutality! And chew-tality!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You got that right.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stanford.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A heavenly choir. You must be an angel!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, you are an angel like Denzel Washington in ""The Preacher's Wife,"" or Will Smith in ""Bagger Vance,"" or Slimer in ""Ghostbusters.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't blame me, blame Tinseltown and its second golden age. May it never end.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay Gabriel, this is a ""bar."" It's where I go to drink ""alcohol,"" which is the mortal equivalent of your ambrosia.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, not with that temper.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, the thing about my family is, there's five of us. Marge, Bart, girl-Bart, the one who doesn't talk, and the fat guy. How I loathe him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, why are we in the woods? Is this heaven?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,...Which is society's fault because...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Me. / Right here. / Oh, me too. / Please.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cooperate?! This is one family that doesn't swing that way.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gimme that beer!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, family huddle.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here's how it's gonna go down. As a family, we drive away. We cover for each other -- as a family. It's what Gabriel would have wanted.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, but talk like this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, Gabriel. We're learning to work together.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no! The roast beef is making them stronger -- and the falafel is making them angrier!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No! I will never... Oh wait, it's Blatz.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, they're all right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,WOLVES AND COUGARS ATE OUR ROAST BEEF!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I knew it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yep. Our family is as functional as all get out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it's the woman I married in Vegas!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Give it to me, baby.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's okay. We're married.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm sorry, but it wasn't my fault. Liquors drunkened me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, I did marry her, but I abandoned her. Amber, tell her how I abandoned you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, I married her, but that is as far as we went. We never, ever made whoopee -- or even mouth whoopee.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You can't kick me out. It'll cause a miscount in the census. A miscount!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Of all the things that have ever come back to bite me in the ass, this is the worst.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Please, just leave me alone.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah... Oh, that's good... Oh, don't stop. Oh, yeah...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Faster... Faster... Faster... Oh, you do that like a pro...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Use both hands...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can't panic! Must remain calm.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, the sweet couple of seconds before I remember why I'm sleeping on the lawn.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you're speaking to me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Talk about what? Sports? Bigamy?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not a sports fan, huh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, there are only so many times I can say I'm sorry and still mean it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I would if it wasn't for the kids.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, that's the last we'll see of them. Come on, we're goin' to Moe's.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"My lady's glass is empty, Moe. Bring her another cookies 'n' creme martini.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, she could put that mole anywhere on her face.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,To Amber... who proves there are seconds in the buffet of life.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A library selling books? If I don't want 'em for free, why would I want to pay for 'em?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my God! Wow. Now that's a goiter.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"She said ""tavern"". I'm going to Moe's!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Peace, my people. All shall be looked up. Let's see, most clothespins: swallowed, inserted... here we go, clipped to face and neck. One hundred and sixteen.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, the best book you've ever seen is Tom Clancy's ""Op Center.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, here's a good one: The World's Most Overrated Saint.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've used up all these records.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's a great idea. Do you think I could run a mile in three and a half minutes?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The Simpsons are goin' to Mars, so pack your... Or maybe I'll think of something else.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're a cinch to be World's Fattest Man.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm here to break a world record. What's the longest anyone's ever done this?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fine, I'll just play the banjo with this cobra.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait, wait, wait...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But it's my banjo.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, they're called ""Congress"".",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Group stunt?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Denver?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fellow Springfielders. I have called you all here so we can enter the Duff Book of World Records.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We're going to build the world's tallest human pyramid!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay. Lemme check the specs.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, my vision is coming to life!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mm-hm.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right. I'll make a base camp here and try for the summit tomorrow.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ha! Ha! We did it! Springfield rules!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo-Hoo! In your face Milwaukee!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now that everyone's so open about being fat, I can finally stop sucking in my gut.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, you can't improve on nature.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait. You went to a sugar factory? Were there Oompa-Loompas?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, well. If it isn't the woman who's too busy saving the world to save her own marriage.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It was dinner.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I was hoping we could do that together.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I am so proud of you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get in the car.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thank you, Erin Choco-snitch. That was a group effort.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, good work, Blue-hair 'n' Brocko-witch. Okay, that was mine.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nothing left! Nothing left!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, ooh, a sticky spot!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Part of me knew that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm with you all the way. But first...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cool. Should I take off my shoes?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cool.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Count Fudge-ula? I thought you wanted to get off the stuff.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you mean Tennessee?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm only doin' this one more time.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Eww. I touched it. Over.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Kinda.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on! Give it! I know, I'll try reverse psychology. I don't want that stupid map.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That wasn't part of the deal!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Has everyone keistered their personal supply?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,'Cause I sure haven't.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No way! We'll defy you to the death!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Remember what I told you about running away from your troubles?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let's do it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Before I bring the sugar in, I want to see the Oompa-Loompa.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That guy is freaky. Well, here's your sugar.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, they both make such good arguments.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No Marge, I love when you do that. You're a regular Carin' A-lot-ovich.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's what I told Lisa!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, there's nothin' better than relaxin' with my favorite magazine.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, they're showing the filling now. Can they do that?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the hell is that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Rainbows... tank tops... empowerment... This is the Gay Pride Parade! Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look at those abs.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Everyone here has a six pack and I'm the only one with a keg.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's it, we're outta here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Four tickets for ""Shenani-Goats!"".",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, show the movie!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm laughing but it's a laugh of impatience. Show the movie!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So many previews. So many previews. So many previews.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Start the movie!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stop the madness! Start the movie!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm not scared of those ushers! What are they gonna do? Advance on me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So long, suckers!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My mouth. My beautiful mouth.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Broken jaw?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mm hmm.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm horny!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nicely done.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And when I couldn't talk, I learned to listen.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I learned so much about my family. You'd be surprised how much you hear if you just listen once in a while.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I was just tellin' all the guys how losing the power of speech made me a better man.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sure thing, Alky.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Krackle was my favorite.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, as much as humanly possible.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ostrich burgers! Get your ostrich burgers!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, you pick one out and I'll punch it to death.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dude, I thought we were friends.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm not proud of that clip.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I don't know. The demolition derby is next month...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, okay. For you I'll be as dull as Dilbert.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm gonna kill you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, and I was merely reading the title: ""I'm gonna kill you.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yep. Nothin' to get excited about.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Professor Van Doren, so good to see you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I just poured myself a new glass of milk. The old one sat out for a little while. Are you comin' to bed?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I could stand here and argue with you, but then I'd have to get a new glass of milk. Goodnight, honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge? Marge is gone! But at least the Demolition Derby form is...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?! Nooo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Listen to all that revving!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Drivers, start your engines!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But bold moves are no longer my forte!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, what do I do? What do I do?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, this beer's deliskous. I'm gonna saves me wife! Now let's get this show on the road.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Quit banging my wife!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Looks like I need some fuel for me mule. Gas for me ass.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, looks like a little angel. Now to save me Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's okay, Marge, you're a good wet blanket. The kind I like wrapped around me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here's to a happy, well-rested Marge!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Unguarded breakfasts -- the sweetest taboo.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's goin' on?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Marge, it's that guy who couldn't get any off ya.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Spill it, moneybags.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's like being married to my best friend, and he lets me feel his boobs.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hm, a million dollars? Wait a minute. How much sex would be involved? 'Cause if it's ""some""...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Marge, I just thought of something.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If we had Artie's money, I could get that snoring surgery. Plus at least two of those other surgeries I desperately need.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,One squeaking-spring symphony coming up.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, I...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Honey, did you get any sleep?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'm so sorry.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh huh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay Ziff, you get her for the weekend, but no funny stuff.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And by funny stuff I mean handholding, goo goo eyes, misdirected woo -- which is pretty much any John Woo film--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This round's on me, Moe. I got a big payday comin'.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah. Homer sold his wife for a million bucks.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I didn't sell her. I just rented her to an old boyfriend.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Gee, a million bucks, that's gonna buy him a lot of, uh... Swings in the old battin' cage.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait, you really think Marge is gonna fall for this guy? Even after I bought her that hockey-fight tape?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh God, you're right. I've gotta get her back before it's too late.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's enough running.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my God, it's our high school prom! And once again I have no date!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, Dondelinger.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just for twenty-five years.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh no. If Marge marries Artie, I'll never be born!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh guys, it was horrible. I saw Marge kissing a far superior man.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"My life here is over. Lenny, how'd you like to leave town with me, and never come back?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then it's settled. We leave Springfield forever.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I saw something terrible, and I can't even say it so I'll have these two dolls do it for me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm leaving you, Marge. The next time you see my name will be in the hobo obituaries. Don't worry about the kids -- I'll drop 'em off with Patty and Selma.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Patty and Selma? Screw that!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just run the camera, you little...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Goodbye, my darling.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it's no good. Everything reminds me of Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What did Carl think?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do you have any jobs for a man who wants to die? Something indoorsy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This job'll be perfect. I'm gonna leave this world the way I entered it -- dirty, screaming and torn away from the woman I love.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Another oil well successfully capped.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh no! This is how Faceless Joe lost his legs!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why? So I can watch my wife spend the rest of her life in the arms of another man? I don't think so. Good day.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We said ""Good day""!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Artie, thanks for saving my life. Now, I believe there's a little matter of the million dollars...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I can't take his money... I can't print my own money... I have to work for money... Why don't I just lie down and die?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I gotta hand it to Artie Ziff, Marge. That little nerd saved my life.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Goodnight, honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No. The Olympics have preempted my favorite shows for the last time!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You wait 'til next month! You wait 'til next month!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm bored. Heyyy... a fair!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But knowing about it would make you want to go here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ten-four, princess. Is that your beer tent?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Monkeys cry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wee! Wee! Wee! Wee!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Marge, watch me burn Flanders. Ned Flanders bids fifty dollars.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, honey. We can't afford this now, but when it's time for college, I promise my darling daughter can go to the finest school there is.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,In South Carolina.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You will too!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Go gamecocks!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, boy. Here's my advice on women: don't give them nicknames like ""jumbo"" or ""boxcar"" and always get receipts -- it makes you look like a business guy...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the hell is that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, what kind of mileage does it get?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, one time, she-- Oh, she's looking at us. Be cool.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, gentlemen. Would you care to meet my new best friend...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Rainier Wolfcastle.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"These courtside seats are great. Thanks for the hookup, Wolfie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That I do, sir.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,DE-FENSE! DE-FENSE! DE-FENSE!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ouch! I sat on something sharp!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I have a Boyle on my ass.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cockfight.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Canada? Why should we leave America to visit America Junior?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, Son. We'll all go -- first class!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Doesn't matter. They have free health care.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm rich!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Would a U.S. dollar change your mind?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There she is, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen to me, son. No one loves a quitter. So you go over there and you win her back.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I quit. There's no convincing you. I'm gonna take a nap.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh, I'm sick of this Tarzan movie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Really? Ooh, this I gotta see.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, he just wants to make friends.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, who's a good dog? What a goody doggie! Oh what dee de bobo! Echee chee googie!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,He's a good doggie!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ooh it-it ooh googie googie!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look Bart, sometimes dogs, or people, hate you for no reason.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just you wait!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey boy, where'd you get that hat?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No kidding? Hey, speaking of achievers, they're thinking of spraying your old man's work space for ticks.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's just not fair. This Buck fella's had all the advantages --horse-riding lessons, the finest makeup, delicious studio food...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Swell.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Because I want to be your hero. On top of which I don't look bald.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,One of the wheels broke off my chair today. But I didn't make a movie about it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,CAN'T KEEP IT IN...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've seen fancier.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, listen to you. ""Ooh, ooh, I'm too old to change. "" How old are you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've seen drunker.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,For shame!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, I couldn't help noticing Buck is a total fraud. So I took the liberty of creating a new hero for your wall.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I thought if you were looking to worship someone, maybe it could be your old man?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My son lost his hero. This should be the greatest night of my life. How come I'm not happy?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stop saying that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nice old man. Don't break a hip.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mmmm, something smells delicious.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm still not givin' up on Buck. There must be some hare-brained half-assed way...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get me Buck McCoy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Here you go. Just stop this bank robbery and you'll be a hero again. I'll wait in the car.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That hurts. But I just have one question: do you want my son to be disappointed in you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You don't need that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dad!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whoa. There's nothing wrong with a little hey-hey!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Aren't you forgettin' someone?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And don't you forget it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not now, Marge. I'm waitin' for the new XFL season. Who will win this year's Million Dollar Game? Who? Who?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The ""X"" is for extreme!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who told you?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And he never even lived to be a vegetable.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, my Dad never even knew how I felt about him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sure, I said I loved him. But never that I was ""in love"" with him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, Dad... We've got what people never get, a second chance.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll call you. Or send you some fruit.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You sunk my Scrabbleship!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Tell that to the good men who just lost their lives.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Semper fi.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You? No way. It's too dangerous.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That was a D.W.I.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, you brought me into this world, so no.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dad, get up.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No way.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no. I'm not giving you my car. You'll probably drive it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, a booth. If I'm tired, I can just lie down!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No you can't.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're slow to react, Dad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,In real life he would die.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, watch the movie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Give me those keys. Do you have any idea what you put us through? I called the police, the hospital, my bookie, the kennel... Okay, this isn't about who I called.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lisa doesn't borrow my car and stay out all night with some... hoochie.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Straight up, Marge. That hoochie only likes you because you can drive.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Turn that down! You call that music? I-- I just don't know what to do.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, he's gotta learn, Marge. The way my dad made me learn.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cosmic.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And another thing: no death races!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that is it! Abraham J. Simpson, you are never driving again!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ever!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh sure, when he does something bad, he's my father.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We've gotta go after them.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, we'll wait for the next one.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here we are: Branson, Missouri!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Only in public.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Overdue book?! This is the biggest frame-up since O.J. Wait a minute... blood in the Bronco... the cuts on his hand... those Jay Leno monologues... Oh my God, he did it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah, I checked that out when Bart was born. I was gonna read to him every day.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stuff kept comin' up -- mostly car-related. Piece of crap...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I decide who reads and when. How 'bout now?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hm, ""Homer's Odyssey."" Is this about that mini-van I rented once?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That mini-van had the biggest cup holders. And change slots for every coin, from penny to quarter!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It was the end of the Trojan War. Clever Odysseus had come up with a plan to destroy the Trojans once and for all...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid King of Troy. I think I speak for all the Greeks when I say this war has gone on for too long.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Anyway, over torture, one of your soldiers mentioned that you collect giant wooden animals. We hope you don't have a horse.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Trojans.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If I'm laughing at what I think I am, it's very funny. Anyway... ""As night fell, the Greek soldiers crept from the wooden horse...""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, I can return to Ithaca, and my sweet wife Penelope.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Forget it. Sacrificing animals is barbaric. Now have the slaves kill the wounded.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Gentlemen, I must be wasted, 'cause it looks like that cloud is mad at me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, if they kiss as good as they lure... wow!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Almost home!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks for your help with the anchor, guys. Guys?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That pig looks like Lenny.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmm! That's the next best thing to eating Lenny.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm still hungry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Those were my friends?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's it, I'm going home. Which way to Ithaca?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This truly is Hell!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Honey, I'm home!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'm sorry I was gone so long. But I'm gonna do something I haven't done for twenty years -- take out the trash.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sweet Penelope, you're just as beautiful as you were when I left.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Quit suffocating me. I'm going to Moe's.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, here's the story of Joan of Arc...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This one takes place in a make-believe kingdom called ""France...""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...The French were fighting the English, in The Hundred Years War, which was then called ""Operation Speedy Resolution.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, how's it going with the breakfast pÃ¢tÃ©?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Victory? We're French! We don't even have a word for it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Burn this guy! He lost our good bucket!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Our next story is ""Hamlet,"" by William Shakespeare.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't know, but that would be hot. ""Once upon a time there was a young prince of Denmark.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's cold outside. You'll need a sweater. A sweater!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, it's not only a great play, but also became a great movie. Called ""Ghostbusters.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now that's what I call a moon shot.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm pretty sure it wasn't.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, did you make a prank call to Brazil?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Choke on your lies!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Which phone company? There are hundreds of them. And they all keep changing their names.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We are not paying this bill.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fine, I'll cut off your ponytail.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, it's called negotiating.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooo, fascinating.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I told you, I have too much time on my hands.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why didn't you call me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's it. They have awoken a sleeping giant.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get me tools and beer.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Free service, here we come.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, let's try the red one.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, I'll try the green.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let's try the red one again.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not again! Ow! Let's try 'em together.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maybe the red one...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How did I get here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The one I didn't make and Marge didn't make and Bart didn't make and hence no one in the house made.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, the one we both like.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't you know the boys from Brazil are little Hitlers? I saw it in a movie. Whose name I can't remember.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No way. I still haven't lost the weight I put on from the last one.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I said forget it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that poor little boy. We've got to find him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How many people live in Brazil?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then it's settled. The Simpsons are going to Brazil.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The Simpsons are going to Antarctica. Next year. This year, Brazil.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. So in August... it's cold?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And in February... it's hot?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So it's opposite land. Crooks chase cops, cats have puppies...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So hot snow falls up?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Forget every word, boy. It's useless.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow. It's like He's on the dashboard of the entire country.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Way ahead of you, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,TAKE ME TO THE HOTEL / MY HANDS ARE ON A GUY'S ASS / BOY THIS DUDE MUST WORK OUT...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look Marge, I'm Brazilian.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I got it, I got, I got it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, and a mini-bar hat.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,...I WILL EAT THIS TOBLERONE / AND I WILL NOT PAY!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There he is! It-- Oh wait, you said brown hair, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, they look like Skittles.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now Lisa, it's not as bleak as that. Can you fly me over town to look for him?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, too much junk in the trunk, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But you're on vacation, honey. I'm not wearing my wedding ring!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We'll do our best, honey. Now let's get goin'.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Check please.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Does that include tip?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How did you know?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mine keeps disappearing. Oh, well.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I hope they're goin' somewhere good.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay boy, let's strut our stuff. I GO TO RIO"") I'M IN RIO / AND I'M WALKING ON THE BEACH / I'M IN MY SPEEDO...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gimme a drink with all your sweetest Brazilian fruits mixed together.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sweet. Sweet! SWEET!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ahhh...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Bart. How many more places do we have to search?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Taxi!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So that means I don't have to pay the fare.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fine. Take me, but let the boy go.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh, same old garbage!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This corn doesn't look so big.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll regroup at Red Lobster!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You ain't pretty no more!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, look. I've made some friends. And now, go do my bidding... whatever it may be!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So Lisa says by killing their enemy, I became the alpha-crow.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm sure he'll turn up. Look, here's one of his buttons.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There's Russell Crow, Cameron Crow, Crow Diddly, Hume Crow-nyn, Gregory Peck...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's a murder, honey. A group of crows is called a murder.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Drop it in, don't cram it in. Oh, forget it, I'll do it myself.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Awww, look, Maggie wants to fly too.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, cut it out! Put her down!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, thank God you're okay.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, that was not cool. We need to lay down some ground rules--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We'll get to that. Right now, I think we need some time apart--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, that's it. Shoo, you stupid crows! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That is not a worm.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow! Ow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I hate getting stitches in my eyes. Stupid crows.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hm, fascinating. Say doctor, can you do something about my searing pain?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Does it go in the butt?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, man. I don't do drugs.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I had a bad experience with drugs...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"For me, the sixties ended that day in nineteen seventy-eight.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But isn't marijuana, or ""dope,"" illegal?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, let's see: ""Toke as needed. Caution: objects may appear more edible than they actually are.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,SMOKE ON THE WATER / DOO DOO DOO DOO / DOO DOO DOO DOO / DOO DOO DOO / DOO DOO,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"THEY BURNED DOWN THE GAMBLING HOUSE - IT DIED WITH AN AWFUL SOUND / I AM HUNGRY FOR A CAN-DY BAR / I THINK I'LL EAT A ""MOUNDS""...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, it's making my eyes better, and it's legal.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I could walk up to the President and blow smoke in his stupid monkey face and he'd just have to sit there groovin' on it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I just realized: I am the ""ow"" in the word ""now"". And if you tell anyone...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, it's me. I got Marge on the other line and she is totally bumming me out.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I didn't. But now Daddy's special medicine...,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Oh man, this is long. Could you read it to me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow. Wow. God does so much for me. And he doesn't ask anything in return.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Done and done. Now, do Wiggum.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I said Wiggum!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oops! I thought this was the can, man.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You just said it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're covered with a very fine fuzz.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hardly working...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whoa, whoa, one question at a time. Yes, you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah? Well, I've got news for you. I just got promoted and it's all thanks to ""Yes-I-cannabis.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We have a kitchen?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look at Shemp! He is so high!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And ""Otto"" is ""Otto"" backwards.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"As soon as I graduate, I am so outta here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We gotta get out and stop that initiative. Marge, I'm gonna need ten thousand veggie burritos.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good afternoon. I want to thank you all for coming down here, taking time off from your jobs...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,'Cause we need to keep medical marijuana legal!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whether you suffer from glaucoma, or you just rented ""The Matrix,"" medical marijuana can make things fabulous. Medically.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So my mellow fellow citizens, when you go into that voting booth on Tuesday the seventh...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh man, they already voted. And we lost!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, man, I can't believe we spaced on the date.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, we can't just stand here staring at our hands.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Although, wow!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I could have smoked that pot. And worn that hair.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Eyes? What the hell are you talkin' about?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right. I'll do it for my kids.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Never!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah. Get out.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Going cold turkey isn't as delicious as it sounds.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's been three days. And my mind is clearer, my sperm count is up, and I'm able to recognize simple shapes and patterns.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Unregardless, I will no longer be a slave to this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"As a reminder, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Y'ello.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I can't find you funny anymore.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This stuff can make anything funny... even the show that follows Friends. But I promised my family I wouldn't smoke it anymore.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Start inhalin', Waylon.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You mean that guy on 60 Minutes who yells all the time?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, man. Oh, man. We killed Mr. Burns. Mr. Burns is gonna be so mad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So what? Mr. Burns is dead.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bill Clinton, everyone! He's Jimmy Carter with a Fox attitude.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And now a man you will see is definitely not dead... Mr. Montgomery Burns!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Burns, as we're running long, may we skip your speech and go directly to the questions?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Burns, may I field that one?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's true we're losing money...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But there's no reason we can't dance, dance, dance the night away.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mr. Burns has left the building!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And you wanted to take him to the hospital.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Want a chocolate?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Waiting for my wife. She has a surprise for me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Did you say ""life story""?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Things started out great. I ate what my mother ate. And my mother loved chili. Then, suddenly:",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't you have criminals to catch?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My father and I were never really close.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I never found true happiness until I met Marge.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And life just gets more exciting.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then came the day that changes every couple forever. The day we got our elephant.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"While I wait for my family, I'll tell you about the time my baby shot my boss.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, the family car... we've been through a lot together...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All my other senses are getting sharper. Bart, you had pizza for lunch. Lisa, you're extremely depressed.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Kathleen Turner!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are the proceeds going to charity?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That was at my expense. What kind of a roast is this?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm sick of your lies. Secrets and lies. It's always secrets and lies.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,What kind of a monster would humiliate me like this?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why that little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stupid ""Bart-toon""! Bart-toon, that's clever. I'm gonna kill him!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stop it! The more you rock, the angrier I get!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Leave me alone!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, uh... we're just rehearsing for ""Angry Dad: The Motion Picture"".",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's just so obvious!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It should be Gary Oldman!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm just passionate -- like all us Greeks.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I am...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my gosh, you're right. I'm a rage-aholic. I just can't live without rage-ahol!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is it also the last step?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Very well. I'm not gonna be Angry Dad for one day longer. I'm giving up anger forever!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I said anger.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I gave up anger forever. From now on, I'm into candles, soft music and horse tranquilizers.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, nothing can make me mad out here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,

Homer Simpson,Stop it now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I need some supplies: a keg of beer, and a six-pack to hold me till I tap the keg.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thanks. Are you sure you don't want to come? In a Civil War reenactment we need lots of Indians to shoot.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hi-Yo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my God! I know you must get this all the time, but can I suggest a flavor?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Grape.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,She likes you! Put in a good word for grape.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Now Apu, when you gave me this keg it had dents. And here's proof.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Apu?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That giggle is none of my business. Or is it?,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Nothing, nothing. There's nothing eating me up inside.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let's go.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know, can you believe it? Oh, Manjula's just gonna die!",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Dirty love. I mean, thirty love. I mean, anyone for penis? I'll just get the shuttlecock.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here, guys.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why don't you play this?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, why are you crying? You're not in any physical pain. The only kind of pain a man can understand.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,He already knows. Let's tell Krusty.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That guy's hilarious. His reaction would be priceless.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Apu is cheating!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think he's building to something.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...So anyway, if you take that bottle down, and pass it around--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, this isn't easy, so I'm just gonna come out and say it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Let's say this pepper got married to this salt shaker, and along comes sexy Mrs. Dash...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I saw you and that Squishee Lady -- canoodling like junkyard rabbits!,,,,,

Homer Simpson,U.S.A.! U.S.A.!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And Krusty. We gotta invite Krusty.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Wait, wait. You forgot to eat a light bulb.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Here you go. Don't worry. I soaked it in the toilet to soften it up.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, hookers and Spiderman.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Hey, hey, hey, no peeking.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Happy anniversary, Marge!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the hell is that noise?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, the poor thing's in pain. What he needs is a visit from kindly old Dr. Foot.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fine, I won't kill it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Finish the job.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you sure God doesn't want it to be dead?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If he wants to sleep with us, forget it.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Uh, he's sleeping.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, uh, the thing about that is, uh...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! He's alive. Now you can't punish me.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,But what about the axe?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh, you're the shut-in.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...so I threw the super ball so hard it hit the ceiling twice, then broke a lamp.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, I've gotten a lot of compliments about my talking.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My pleasure.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I can ride my bike real fast.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I'm not running an employment service, you old ba-- Oh-ho-ho, you mean me? I'd be delighted.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Y'ello! Hi, Mrs. Bellamy. No, I'm not doing anything. I can mow your lawn.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cover for me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello?... Uh-huh. Yes Mrs. Bellamy, I'll be right there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I can't say no to a helpless old lady. They put spells on you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Laxative?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The Missus prefers you call me Simpson.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you all right?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't worry. You're gonna be just fine. I--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,O-kay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Buh... guh... muh... wuh. Zuh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Without a trace.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh-ho, so it's a good thing she died. From our point of view. Financially.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now if you'll excuse us, we'll just be... DOES THAT EVER WORK?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Book 'im, Lou.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You'd be dead a million times.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh man, what a day. I'd kill for a beer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'd stab somebody for a pickle.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gimme some peanuts.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll kill you if you don't give me some peanuts.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What? It goes right by our house.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Here's my underwear drawer.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mrs. Bellamy's necklace!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know Chief, if you let us go, there's a diamond necklace in it for you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, Marge. I'll cut us a deal by becoming a jailhouse snitch. I know who stopped up the toilet!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can't you do anything? Surprise witnesses? Evidence tampering? Play the race card. Play it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let's just say I'm planning a little surprise for the execution. This cannon is going to be full when I go off. Ka-boom!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Y'know, this is our last night... and our cells are side-by-side...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just think of them as twinkling stars.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I want to confess. I killed and robbed the old lady all by myself. Marge is completely innocent. The only thing she's guilty of is loving too much the murder I did.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now you do it for me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Goodbye, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I knew it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This whole thing was a joke? Oh, I've never been so relieved! Relieved and angry.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm glad everyone's all right, but I think you should be ashamed -- toying with a human life for TV ratings.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've made my choice.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So hot, so sticky...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You know what will cool this place down? A little touch of winter.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, if we start conserving, the environmentalists win!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Jingle bell what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A blackout?! Every time Santa and I get together it's a disaster.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no! They're stealing the tire fire!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No! I've caused enough trouble already by plugging in that Santa Claus. No more irresponsible behavior.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, but not the imported.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You've got to set limits, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah. Wiggum couldn't catch cooties at Milhouse's birthday party.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh. Seriously, everyone says your parties rock.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I admit it. I did screw up, but I won't feel guilty until I can put a human face on this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wrong answer.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, doesn't Lisa have a human face?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's it. Nobody messes with my little girl. I'm gonna find those dolls.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"See, when you don't use Milhouse, it's hard. I love this kid.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Interesting. All right, I've come up with a composite sketch of my prime suspect.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Exactly.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look at him over there, eating that apple. What's he planning? What?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're right. What's this?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A cap!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"From ""The Woolly Bully.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do you sell hats?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,To people?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,People with heads?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Did you steal dolls from my daughter?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well think again. Son, you're going to juvie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good, 'cause I need directions.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Aw...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you know, stopping criminals is fun. And I felt like a big man pushing that kid around.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cheese!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, well... Heh, heh. Hm... oh, I'll... no....",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, I've had a lot of jobs: boxer, mascot, astronaut, imitation Krusty, baby proofer, trucker, hippy, plow driver, food critic, conceptual artist, grease salesman, carny, Mayor, grifter, bodyguard for the Mayor, country western manager, garbage commissioner, mountain climber, farmer, inventor, Smithers, Poochie, celebrity assistant, power plant worker, fortune cookie writer, beer baron, Kwik-E-Mart clerk, homophobe, and missionary. But protecting Springfield, that gives me the best feeling of all.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Finally, a way to combine my love of helping people with my love of hurting people.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fellas, I'm starting my own private police force. Will you join me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How 'bout Lenny?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You'll do as I say or I'll have your badges. Once I make and give you your badges.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Flanders, I was able to find your missing leaf blower, belt sander and morning newspapers.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who said it was a he?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who said you did?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're pushing your luck, pal.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, ooh! Here's my commercial!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Is this you? If it is, don't dial nine one one. Simply dial six three six five five five three four seven two.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Have no fear, SpringShield's present!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The only friend you need is SpringShield.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, the old lady's apartment was actually Lenny's. We just used a different duvet cover.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Green vegetables and homework.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Even dessert?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! I'm Chief of Police.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now that I am the law, I'm gonna make a lot of changes around here. First, I'm gonna cut overhead by freeing Otis, the lovable town drunk.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What a character.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, according to this, he's tellin' the truth.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, Fat Tony. Your little game is over.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If that thug thinks he can run me out of town... oh man, I love this song.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'VE BEEN DRIVING ALL NIGHT, HAND'S WET ON THE WHEEL... THERE'S A VOICE IN MY HEAD THAT DRIVES MY HEEL... IT'S MY BABY CALLIN' ON THE TELEPHONE... I GOT SOME PIZZA AND I'M BRINGIN' IT HOME...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You all know me. I've kept the streets safe for you and your children. I've tricked or treated at many of your houses. Last year I was Jar Jar Binks. Now, who will stand and fight with me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Shut up, Flanders. Anyone else? What about you, Dr. Hibbert?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,After everything I did you're going to abandon me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What, and let them come after you and the kids?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,In one car? With no air conditioning? And the little poop machine going every twenty minutes?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I need you guys to help me. Why'd you lock yourselves in?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't get it. I finally did a job where I wasn't lazy, stupid, or corrupt -- and now I'm gonna get killed for it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, you can kill me, but someone'll take my place. And if you kill him, someone'll take his place. And that's pretty much the end of it. The town'll be yours.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but this town doesn't deserve me. I'm giving this badge to the next guy I see.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I must have a guardian angel -- with a rifle.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, she's taking a nap.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"She's just like Clark Kent. When there's lots of excitement, she's nowhere to be found. Nighty-night, sweetie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now to spend some quality time away from my family.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'd love to, but someone made me too many pancakes and now I have to sleep them off.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Were they now?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The hammock man! I'm glad he's a little early today.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You had me at comfort.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Hammock, say hello to Madam Ass.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the...? It made another me! How cool is that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hm, no belly-button.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shuttle's in the hangar!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You wanna be my slave?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Outstanding.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Speed it up, ugly.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh, he had a good run.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm gonna need help with this.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hm...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, you've got chores to do.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Clone?! That's ridiculous. Where am I supposed to find a... wait a minute.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, four of me. I think this could be a magic hammock. And it just might be the answer to my problems.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll take it from here, Fake-o.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-huh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man, are we evenly matched.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I mean, four!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but you'll have to leave a credit card.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ned...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Twenty-three. Now, today I'm gonna mow the lawn, do my taxes, shoot hoops with Bart and girl it up with Lisa.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ohh, I gotta get rid of these guys.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now before I abandon you in this cornfield, does anyone remember the way home?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Anybody else?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Anybody else? Come on...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, everyone out!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now to make sure this hammock never troubles anyone again.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You'd think so, but no.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, it's a good group.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Noooo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We're out of donuts!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Good news.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not Mr. Blasty?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's okay, boy. You'll be shooting angels in heaven.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, let me do a solo. This could be my big break.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, so are the Grammy judges. --",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gimme!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hear me, people of the past!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I come to deliver a terrifying message of hope. Grab your guns and follow me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, how to explain this to a child... Hm... Future Daddy needs to double-kill these corpses so they won't come back as zombies, and-- Get 'im!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what could be more fun than an island shaped like a big smiley face?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I've been around Scotsmen.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I'm on vacation.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You mean, they're gonna try to sell us time shares?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bring back some ice.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What's up, honey? Want a little lovin'?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Isn't vacation sex always the best?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you were like a wild beast. So voracious and prowly.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I've never seen you use your tail like that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my God! She's become a monster! Which I have to admit, I sort of suspected during the sex.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gotta find a way to change Marge back. And replace the M&Ms I took from the mini bar.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Flanders?! A perfect vacation ruined.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, I really don't wanna do that, Ned.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, you're not helping.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"IN THE JUNGLE, THE CREEPY JUNGLE / HOMER RIDES A FREAK...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't believe it. Hibbert's turned you all into human guinea pigs!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Eat... my... shorts?! Why you little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maggie!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lisa!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What game?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Manimals, invertebroads! You must fight back against the one who did this to you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait'll Moe sees how wasted I got without him. He's gonna plotz.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You guys are nuts. All you can do is eat and sleep and mate and roll around in your own filth and mate and eat... where do I sign up?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hi, Moe, got any beer?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the-- Where's my money?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So you're just gonna let me walk out of here sober.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And you can live with that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine. There are plenty of other ways for me to alter my consciousness.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lick 'em. Go away.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Jewish? Oh, no, I'm not Jewish.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, Moe...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, I don't care about the color of your skin, Lenny. You're my friend!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you'd like that wouldn't you, ya...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've had just about enough of you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm outta here...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you want my keys?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Get 'em now, jerks.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So long, jerks.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Running after the car, huh? Let's see if you can follow this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Moe's Tavern.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good morning, everybody! What's for breakfast, cutie?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What? Wait a... That can't be right! Wait, was last night the night we set the clocks ahead eight hours?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If I was that drunk, I would remember it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Couldn't you come up with a less embarrassing lie?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Of course. It was, uh... some kind of a... light rail.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, won't anyone pretend to believe me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And that's why you're my favorite.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, time for my favorite show.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't remember anybody telling me I was gonna be on TV.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, I'm pretty great...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That my family isn't the center of my universe? Are you nuts?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I can't believe they took ""Monkey Trauma Center"" off for this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lousy family...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A hot babe...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I don't resent you, sweetheart. What I was trying to say, and maybe I didn't use the right words, was that marriage is like a coffin and each kid is another nail, but as coffins go...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, what have I done?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's this suitcase for? Are we going on a trip?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where are you taking me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You can't just leave me out here! There's not another woman for miles!,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"I'm okay. I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what gives? Where are all the rock stars?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What was that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! It's Mick Jagger and Keith Richards...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo! STD's!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,To rock!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you ready...to receive professional training in rock?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I am so excited I couldn't fall asleep! I even took some pills I found on the floor and still nothing!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh-huh. Now I'm afraid that if I stop talking, I'll die. Isn't Mick cool? I thought he'd be all like, ""I'm a rock star. Aren't I great?"" But he's just like you or me or Jesus over there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Out of my way, Nerdlinger.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Here you go.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, I'm telling Mr. Jagger.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Like this, Mr. Kravitz?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mr. Seltzer?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I think it's Seltzer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I came up with a stage move I feel is very cool.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Baby, baby, baby, baby!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry Mick!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'M SO HOT FOR ME, I'M SO HOT FOR ME / I'M SO COLD...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bor-ing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But rock stars are supposed to be about drinking and getting drunk and boozing it up.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Precisely.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I got 'em!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm entitled to a private life! I'm not a role model! And so forth.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We know!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, whaddaya think?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really? You really think I'm better than you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the hell are you doing here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's been a week already?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait, don't go! I wanna keep on rockin'. C'mon guys... a-one, a-two...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Noooo!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No! No, I won't go! You can't make me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I knew nothing!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Never!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"My dream has been shattered into shards of a broken dream. I was so close to being a rock star, but now there's a chance it might not happen. I'll just have to settle for being a fat, bald, fat nothing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm so despondent.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I like it...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,For serious?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can I have forty guest passes?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, All-Access. All-Access...",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Test, test...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Test, test. Check, check.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Test... ""TEST TEST, YOU'RE TESTIN' MY LOVE FOR YOU, CHECK CHECK, YOU'RE CHECKIN' TO SEE IF I'M TRUE...""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,TEST ONE-TEST TWO-TEST THREE-TEST FOUR YOU TEST ME LIKE THE WATER IN EL SALVADOR...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"BABY, BABY, BABY, BABY, BABY... Uh-oh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah... When you've been in as many as I have, you can sense them coming.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What am I, the lost and found?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There's no need for apologies, guys. You're rock stars! You're supposed to be reckless and destructive, and be celebrated for behavior that would land normal people in jail.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, you're very sweet, Mick, but the only rocking I want to do is in my living room chair, surrounded by the world's greatest back-up group, my family.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nah, I've got something to remember 'em by.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Have fun at school, kids.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Rock and Roll! Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I hate reality shows...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I've grown, you haven't.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I can't take any more of these shows. If I wanted reality, I'd finally have this lump looked at.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stupid writers and actors, priced yourselves right out of the business. Nice going, geniuses.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, we can't pinch pennies on the machine that's going to be raising our children.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, kids. Daddy knows a way to get the money... with no risk.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No problem.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Flanders -- check out my new satellite dish!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I bet you would.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Damn your sparkling wordplay!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it's red wire to red wire. What idiot dreamed that up?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmm... feed...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kids, kids, you're both right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Put pie here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Me not pig.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Homicidal robots... so like us.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,They're gonna be in the same class as each other?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,An old army buddy is visiting Mannix?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The status quo.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you can't fool us. We're from the ""Learn to Fart"" state.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, what about Bart?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is where the kids were last seen.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, he's not gonna get very far without that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, is that you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And Maggie, you no longer have to live with the burden of replacing Bart and Lisa.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dew-ey! Dew-ey! Dew-ey!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! I win the bet! Who's your Daddy?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not if I can stop that inauguration!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let's hear it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know it's gonna be bad, but you just can't prepare yourself.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Domiciles for the Destitute? Is this that thing that Jimmy Carter does?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, if Bart can be ""El Barto""...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, thanks...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Huh? Oh, right. Can you hold it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My real ring's inside a turtle.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can I help you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,... And that's how my beautiful wife brought our son Bart into the world.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sure, why not?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, why would I want Purina when I've got Fancy Feast right here?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, it sounds like all you're looking for is a little reassurance. Well...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Did you label the meals so I can tell which is which?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, someone's tucked in to an insane degree. Goodnight!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, gimme some of those blankets.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What's this? It's enormous! Oh my God, there's another one!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Explain later!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I fell off. Hee hee hee.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, he truly is a monster. Hey, let's go out to dinner tomorrow. Just you, me, the kids and the twins. Whadaya say?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, that cinches it. Lisa gets the prize for the best off-the-cuff response.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's not true, Lisa, there are a lot of complicated issues here, that can only be explained through song.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"YOU TOOK A TWENTY-KARAT DIAMOND, AND MADE IT GLEAM / LIKE A BIG SPAGHETTI DINNER, SMOTHERED IN WHIPPED CREAM.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,AND THEY'RE ALL MINE...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... I was gettin' around to it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Forget it Kiki. You're not putting your brain into her body.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No dice. Take your fun and adventure outside.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait for what? Confirmation of my attitude?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Shut up, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"With the economy the way it is, you're lucky you get soup.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Gentlemen, say hello to Springfield's newest supermodel!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm on it.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"I came out the elephant's mouth, right? 'Cause I already showered once today.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kids, I'd like to reintroduce you to classic Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not at all, sweetie. At least one of us should be able to put their arms around the other one.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, we're gonna do a little more than just ogling.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let's go get fried chicken!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH...,,,,,

Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! I got skybox tickets! And with only twenty percent loss of my brain function. Life is...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Check out those non-skybox losers, watching hockey without sushi. If you can call that hockey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why can't they just be happy for my success?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fine, watch your stupid Eagles concert.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whatever.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Because she took the trouble to wander away and talk to a stranger.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hm. Better add some more nails.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Perfect.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, get out, I'm in here! Oh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I go by how funny the sign is.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't worry. We'll just hang out in front of the house beside these garbage cans. The time will just fly by.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh, that was boring. Let's get a hotel.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid Bran Producer's Convention.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know, we'll stay with my very best friend in the world, Lenny.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's Lenny? Oh, I wanted the black one.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So how do you afford such a sweet pad?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who wants to eat a loser?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"1895, forget it. We'd be too late to save Lincoln and too early to save Kennedy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's not a time machine, Moe.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm still not sure about this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll teach you to whistle on the Sabbath!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where's that kid with my latte?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"He's not coming, is he? Is he?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh-ho-ho, you look adorable, Lisa.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, they had an army helmet under every bed!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Befoul an army helmet? You'd like that, wouldn't ya, hippie?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Finally, I'm no longer a slave to the Gillette Corporation.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,This comes off.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, let's see what we've got here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You've been in there over an hour, boy! Other people have to confess too, you know. Oh, I can't hold it in. I hate this house!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, we can't give up. We're on TV. And when you're on TV, you dig in your claws and you never let go. Just like Bill Moyers!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I wish you would reconsider the proposal of Hiram Beatwife.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm off to the blacksmith to get my tooth pulled.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,And now to wreck their precious helicopter.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but... okay... Oh...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That Lenny sure had a crazy apartment.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No more reality shows for us. Let's watch some quality scripted television.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's it! TV was the one good thing in my life and now I can't enjoy it any more.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,If we formed a club we could serve drinks.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good idea, Lisa.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hm, the water's off. I'll use my eye to see what the trouble is.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hm, off again. Maybe I can hear what's going on.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, this has become a game of wits, has it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Perhaps my other eye will get to the bottom of this.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mail call!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The ""George Foreman Mail Sorter"" will let us know.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Your family is invited to a free weekend at Stagnant Springs Spa.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't struggle. You'll only sink faster.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do not use steam room if you are overweight or have a heart condition.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute, I'm not wearing a shirt!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mmm, steamed Gentile.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Triple, no. Definitely no.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, which one of these psychos is gonna help me catch my killer?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well then, you might as well stay with us. We serve the same meat the prisons do!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You'll understand someday when you have kids.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, you don't even have to point it at him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmm... Well, there's Mr. Burns, Fat Tony, The Emperor of Japan, ex-President Bush.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"PBS, Stephen Hawking, the fat little Dixie Chick...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm a people person. Who drinks.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gotcha.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I just wanted to impress you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mardi Gras, eh? Didn't last year's king have to abdicate because he married a commoner?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, if you two country hens are finished clucking, I'd like to buy a copy of Jugs and Ammo.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, Junior. I expect this to be fixed with quality GM parts.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just fix it, Mr. Sasswrench.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Right, right. I'm countin' the pennies in the ashtray. There's two!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're so smart. Shock him.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, someone's coming!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Moe! He's got a dark side I've never dreamed of.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Once I kill you everyone will think I'm the real Homer!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Guys, Bob is my only hope. Back off and give him some room to think.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my God! He's getting closer!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Very well. I am gone!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't look at me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Right here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Good things do happen to bad people!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you're embarrassing me in front of the drag queen.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nonetheless, the people have spoken.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, this is a way to flush this killer out once and for all -- and get drunk on a Tuesday.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I'm not drunk!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now Bob, I know you're concerned, but don't worry. I have operatives working the crowd.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"America loves its Kings, from George the third to Larry.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Phew, just Italians.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my God! Attention drunken idiots: this is your king! Sacrifice yourselves to slow me down!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,They're not for dudes!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I did it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You saved my life!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't be so sure. I've got my legs wrapped around your ass pretty tight.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We're up so high. Where could that shot have come from?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, duh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Your king needs these stilts!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not anymore!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I know you. You're my mechanic, Junior.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Frank Grimes...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Frank Grimes...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah. How is old Grimey?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whoa, wait. Frank Grimes wasn't married. How could he have a son?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We know. Frank Grimes, Jr.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, it's every parent's dream to outlive their children. Goodnight, son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart! Turn down that original cast recording and go to sleep!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Goodnight, sleepyhead. Do you have to poop?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You know what made me feel better about myself? That award I got for World's Greatest Dad.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Which I did.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mm... trophy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Disney World?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gator Gulch?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute... I know where we're going... Oh, it's horrible...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's even boring to fly over it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, God!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let's go make some fireworks of our own.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I wouldn't have it any other way.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Skinner! Do you and Edna want to join Marge and me at ""Great Moments With Mr. Eisner""?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you mean the Enron ride. Let's go.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who will take home The Rampy?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Purple Rain!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Michael Jackson just told me to shut up!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What a rip! You all should be ashamed!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, here's ours. We're going to Disney World!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it's so beautiful.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"One churro, please.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Here!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, nobody likes a shill.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I love that little shill. Let's get her that diary.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh-my-God-oh-my-God-oh-my-God.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Watch and learn.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,More free samples.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh, it's still better than Indian food.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"One Turbo Diary, please.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now what am I gonna get Lisa?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa's not gonna want that. Oh, what can I get her?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What are you buying? Jerk stuff?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, your kid is in the movie -- and the movie knows his name. Maybe Lisa will like this better than the diary. Stupid Flanders, you're a genius!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, yes and no.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mostly no.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But it's a personalized video about my favorite little star -- Lisa Simpson.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Still? Then you're not gonna like your other present.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Maggie, you're her best friend, go talk to her!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, what have I done? Children don't remember bad birthdays, do they?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good morning, honey. Did you cry out all your angries?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Lisa's still mad at me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I did it for the insurance money.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look Lisa, I'm still trying to get to know you. Who's your favorite Traveling Wilbury? Is it Jeff Lynne?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I'm full of questions. What's your favorite cigar size? Is it Robusto? Is it?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, my daughter hates me because I don't know anything about her.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well... if hiring this guy will make Lisa like me again, then I'll do it! Can I get this beer to go?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Drunk cop? Is that you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, pie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My name is Homer Simpson. And I desperately need your help.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How did you know?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Priceless.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I need you to find out everything about my daughter, so she'll think I'm a good Dad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Anything to trick my daughter into liking me. Now, if you need to reach me, my email is chunkylover53 at AOL.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's one word.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Chunkylover53.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dot com.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, the information I've been waiting for.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You should know. It is your favorite album.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait, wait!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I thought you might like to go to an animal rights protest today.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,On the way home we could stop and get your favorite treat: ice...cream!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So sad, yet so sexy, yet so delicious.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, we should get along. I mean after all, I am your... ...father.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mom? Don't you think I could read the report by myself?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, report is a daddy word that means ""loves his daughter.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's right, honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You did it! Lisa thinks I'm the greatest. I might even put you to work on Bart and Maggie, go superdad on all their asses.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yes. Well, let's take a look and see-- a thousand dollars! How did you spend a thousand dollars?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A forty dollar steak?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You've been living like a king on my dollar... Super unleaded gas... Silver bullets?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't believe the man who agreed to follow my daughter around -- for money -- would turn out to be a dirt bag.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You'll regret the day you went to the expensive coffee place!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Of course I do. It's all my fault for refusing to pay...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"... pay attention to you, my sweet little father-loving pile of forgiveness. Yes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I look just like Elvis!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, Rock Strongo.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, Lance Uppercut.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let me just put on my glasses.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're charging how much for a room?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, this is a phone survey. If the election were held today, would you vote for ""A"" the cops are there, or ""B"" you are free to talk?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge. You're not gettin' it, it's me. Homer. Simpson.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, this is from your Mom.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, I can't lie to you any longer... this is all my fault. I'm the worst dad in the world.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The man who framed you is a crooked detective. Who I hired!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,To find out everything about you so I'd seem like a good father.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, all the childless drunks at Moe's thought it was a great idea.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, I'm coming right out the door. Dammit! These windows are so hard to squeeze through!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Cheer up, honey, we're living an all natural existence, the kind you like. Ooh, a trash can. We'll find breakfast in here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, a banana!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's full of cigarette butts. So is this one...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We'll just tell the police and then I'm back to being plain old Rock Strongo.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dexter Colt. The man who framed my daughter.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"In retrospect, yes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll just hide here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now what are you gonna do? You can't shoot all of us.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Damn it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Lisa has excellent hearing. Once when she was three, I was quietly sobbing in the closet and she found me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How ironic. Now he's blind after a life of enjoying being able to see.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, it wasn't easy, honey, but I'm glad you love me again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah. But what's gonna happen to the animals?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, honey. I released them all into the wild.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why certainly son, just hand me that book you've got there...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How the mighty have fallen... into my price range. I wanna go there!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What do I do now?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I'm good.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, your early porno movies! Are any of these hetero?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Got any junk that will go up in value after you die?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The weights that changed you from a Bavarian creme puff to a mass of twitchy muscles?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll take it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no worries. This is what all those hours of playing Tetris were for.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Perfect!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do you think you could give me a lift home?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Your heartbeat is so soothing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's all my fault my wife got mugged.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait Marge, I don't want you to leave the house without this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Emergency whistle, pepper spray and this map of the most vulnerable parts of a man's body.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, like I'm gonna kick Chief Wiggum in the groin.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now Dr. Hibbert said to use a number from one to ten to describe how anxious you are.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't worry. Everything is fine. What the hell is that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's not just a bug, it's the queen of something!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, I'll set fire to the hive.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Run!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yep, but you're still safe at home. After a few practice trips here, the real Kwik-E-Mart will be a piece of cake. Now, Bart will play Apu...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, I'm the first to admit it. I don't write good parts for women.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kids, I'll go find your mother.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dad, we're canceling the rest of the play.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen kids, your Mom is going to be living in the basement. But with our love, she'll get better soon.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then we'll have to smoke her out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why you little... oh, hi Jesus. I was just...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow honey, eating dinner downstairs is great! Isn't it, kids?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, eat your spinach.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes way!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's like we're at Cheers. I loved that show. Because you always knew it was only a half hour till ""Wings."" Then you could just sleep till Monday.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow-wooh-wooh-wooh! I'm married to Joey Heatherton.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, actually, I'm going to eat twice as much.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Alright Mom! / Yay, Mom! / Woo hoo!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, that was amazing! It's like I'm married to Shaft.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'd rather talk about our feelings. I feel that illegal performance-enhancing drugs are too common these days. Rebuttal?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen, my bulky flower, I-I have an early day...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,'Mornin' kids! I made your lunches. They're on the table.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Your mom has a lot of stuff to shave.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow... Ow... Ow... Oww...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Quiet, her muscular ears can hear us.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'm so proud of you, honey. You bulked up, but managed to keep your femininity.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, sir, sorry.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Denser?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Somewhere in that sea of bull hormones is the sweet, wonderful girl I married. The woman who instead of swatting a fly, will give it a bath and send it on its way. I'd sure like to go home and have Jiffy Pop with her.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I miss being your knight in flabby armor.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ready for a real workout, Marge?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Good. Can you wax the car? Ow! Ow! Ow! I'm kidding! I'm kidding!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, well, nachos are nachos.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, I wonder what it would be like to be with a woman like that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmm... Farfetched.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think my leg is broken.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I guess Flanders doesn't have all the luck.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's not fair. I always wanted to drive a food-shaped car.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,They thought of everything! How come all the good things happen to Jesus H. Nice? By which I mean Flanders!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The grass is actually greener on Flanders' side.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No that's not it. He's got some secret. And I'm gonna find out what it is, no matter what it takes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Flanders, what's your secret? You never get arrested, you don't buy your clothes at ""Mr. Blob"" and look at your beautiful lawn. It sickens me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So that's all it takes, a little prayer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ugh, where's the remote?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, since I don't have the remote, I can just get up and change the channel.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute. I'll do what Flanders does.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"O, Merciful God, who has blessed mankind with two kinds of clam chowder, help me find the remote.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,There it is.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Die, monster!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It worked! I got my wish! From now on, I'll pray till my hands are chapped and bleeding.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"O Lord, please guide that diaper into someone's schnozz.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Vengeful God / Loving God. Vengeful God / Loving God. Vengeful God / Loving God. Vengeful God / Loving God. I could do this all day. And I just might. Vengeful God / Loving God. Vengeful God / Loving God.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, I used to think God only helped professional athletes and Grammy winners. But now I realize he helps shmoes like me, too, Carl.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dear Lord, as I think of you, dressed in white with your splendid beard, I am reminded of Colonel Sanders, who is now seated at your right hand, shoveling popcorn chicken into thy mouth. Lord, could you come up with a delicious new taste treat like he did? I command you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmm. Move over eggs. Bacon just got a new best friend: Fudge.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh heavenly God, my son is plagued with homework. With your vast knowledge of the shore birds of Maryland, I know you can help him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can and will. Now to un-stop this sink.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lord, please use your space-age, clog-busting powers on this stubborn drain. Then take some time off for yourself. Fly to France. Have a nice dinner.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Lord, I see thou art working through thy imperfect vessel, Marge. For thou art most wise...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, he's way the Hell up there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, we could live with a stopped-up drain.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You was hiding behind the drywall. Yes you were! I'm glad Social Services didn't see this. Yes I am!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, you coughed up some dry wall.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So that's your answer! I'll sue the church!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It wouldn't be the first time.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I couldn't help it. Those pews are so comfortable.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can I borrow your pen to sign this deposition?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't see anything in this fog.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Woo-hoo! Can I get that in lottery tickets, please?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"He's not giving it to me, God is. Because I prayed for it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's all good.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, this church is our only option. Don't you kids want to live here?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The dog's on board, too.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Aw... he thinks he's papal.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sweet.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I love this song.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I WAS MADE FOR LOVING YOU, BABY / YOU WERE MADE FOR LOVING ME...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF YOU, BABY...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We'll just see about that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm so sorry for all your horrible problems, but this is our dog's room now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're right, Marge. I'll make it up to them. By throwing the bitchin-est beer bash this church has ever seen!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bless you, bless you, how you doin'?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,She went to Lovejoy's temporary church. She's worried about her immortal soul.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh, God's cool.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh look, God's giving us a little shower.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Everybody, look at the much-needed rain. Thank you, God. Now turn the rainwater into wine.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, wet and wonderful God, your flood has driven us to the roof of your church. Surely this has proven whatever point you had.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,God's ignoring me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I guess I learned something here. God is capable of great anger and great mercy. But mostly great anger.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's such a mess. Watch the teeth!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I was going to tell you on my deathbed.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,La la la la la la la la la.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,La la la la la la la. Nothing left. La la la... la... la.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I needed it. I had to buy back some incriminating photos.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look. See. You're fine. And then--oops! Uh-oh. Look out...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know this looks bad, but if you reverse it, Daddy's a hero!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"See, Bart. I saved you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's okay. His cute little hands can't even fit around my neck.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now he's got it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's right. You're mine till you're eighteen. And when you're seventeen I'm gonna know the end is near, so I'm gonna work you like a dog.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, son. At times like this I just look at my bracelet.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Jesus?! I thought it was Gepetto!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who is it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm not opening the door.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is it crispy?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But not too crispy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,See you in court.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Emancipated? Don't you like being a dude?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, my dad was lousy and I didn't sue him. I just dumped him in the cheapest home I could find.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why you little...! Um, I'm sorry, Judge. That's a rare lapse in my normally calm demeanor.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...! Why you little...!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, I just want you to know, whatever that judge decides, I'm gonna be the best dad I can.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! You're still mine! And you thought I was a bad dad before.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmmmm... garnish.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the--? Half goes to Bart. Half goes to my Vegas wife. What's left for Moe?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll show you worse!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I was told this would be televised!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Go ahead, leave. You'll come crawling back.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's right! Crawling on your knees!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Crawling! Oh, he's really gone. He's gone!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look out, son. This one's got a little mustard on it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Attaboy! We just won the World Series! You and me together! Yeah!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Of all the sites on all the web, I had to click onto his.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Did you see that, boy? Your mom thinks you're still here!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"For your information, I've been taking steps to become a better father.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,For the past week I've been carrying around this bag of sugar. It's taught me how to love and care for a child.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the-- where the hell is my sugar?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, son. You're looking well.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Of course, because you wouldn't want to... I paid for your splendor, you...!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do it without the attitude or don't do it at all.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know son, I've been doing a lot of thinking. I was wrong to exploit you, and I won't do it again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, do you think you might see your way clear to moving back in with your maw and me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Psst, Mr. Hawk. May I have a word with you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sure. My son is Bart Simpson and...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry. I just wanna win my son back so badly.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, I make up words too. Anyway, I was wondering if you could pretend to lose to me in a skateboarding contest so I can be a hero to my boy again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Groovy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All the work?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm challenging you, Hawk. In front of all these outcasts and dreamers, who can't even get into the army, if you can believe it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not very!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now to win back my son in comfort and style.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, I could save money by buying separate nuts and mixing them at home.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Woo hoo! I rule this pseudo sport! Come back to me, boy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, that's the dumbest thing I ever heard, you stupid little kid.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Finally, someone explains it to me in words I can understand. Look, boy. I know I did wrong and I am truly sorry.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I put you in humiliating commercials for money, which I spent on myself. I just wish I had an opportunity to make things right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Anything... as long as I can give the money to my son.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well... I am bald and important. Where do I sign?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, Kathy, I'll tell you. It's Viagrogaine. It gives you lots of hair and what you need down there. What are you waiting for, loser?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What did they say about my scalp?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's nice to see a realistic single woman on TV.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, I can't wait to pack that into my colon.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I got arm veins, don't I?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mars, eh? Hmmm, I see no evidence of water.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The Ribwich! The commercials have come to pass!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You seem like an impartial observer. But I've been fooled by so many people in costumes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I could lick you all day long.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,One Ribwich please.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hm, now without lettuce.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I have eaten the ribs of God.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, who doesn't?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That sounds like a magical family moment. I'm sorry I won't be there.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, sweetie, you're the most important thing to me in the whole world. Only very serious Daddy business can tear me from your side.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Three Ribwiches please. And instead of a shake I'd like a blended Ribwich.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not again! First you took away my Philly Fudge Steak, and then my Bacon Balls, then my Whatcha-ma-chicken. You monster!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'd like a large fries, please. And a collector's cup.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, this is amazing. I could follow the Ribwich from town to town.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Maybe I should hook up with you guys. After all, how long do any of us have to live?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You monster! Why did you expel Boogerman?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That was awesome!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm sorry, honey. I can't be here tomorrow. It's the last day the Ribwich is in San Francisco.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You don't understand. It's not just a sandwich. It's about brotherhood. It's about freedom. It's about three days since I've had one! I'm getting the shakes... and I'm getting the fries!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This can only be good.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey! Don't Borgnine my sandwich.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The pig?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Welcome to the real world, hippies!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa? Is this what I've come to? Fighting over a stupid sandwich on my daughter's big day? Mister, I'll take that car.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Daddy made it for your dance recital, honey!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Damn right honey. You're number one on my menu. Now super-size it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, you're the number one speller in this car or in that car or in that car or, don't look at that car.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It came out again.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Enough talk. Dip me, my love.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lower. Lower!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lower!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know, and it doesn't get any easier from here. There's the Tongue-Kissing Festival... Cinco de Ocho... The Hobo Oscars... days just made for lovers. Not widowers, lovers.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Flanders?! Can't a man just drink alone on a Wednesday morning?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ooh! Lemme guess. Skinner's mother. She sure knows how to swing it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sara Sloane? The movie star?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Flanders, I mix Twinkies and Ding Dongs all the time. In Europe they call it a Dinkie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now wait just a minute -- I used to worry Marge was too good for me. She was always thinking of ways to improve me. But then part of her died and she doesn't try any more. So we're all where we want to be.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Who the hell is Mr. Flanders? Oh, Flanders.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello? Yes, I'm Ned Flanders' close personal friend... that's right, hot and heavy... they've never been happier. Oh yes, I she does look pregnant. Now, who might you be? A tabloid? Is that one of those really strong mints? Hello? Hello?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, don't blame me, I voted for the green M&M.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe, what are you doing here?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid Flanders. I'm not giving you any of my secret moves.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, Flanders. I'm always interested in talking about free milk. And if there's cookies involved, so much the better.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,But the book said you would applaud my initiative.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, sir.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ahhh, look at the little eels. Electric eels!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, he does. All my life I've had one dream: to achieve my many goals. Mr. Burns has never given me a thumbs up or a ""way to be"" or a ""you go, girl."" No, he just steps all over everyone who works for him, taking pleasure in making us feel small.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks for trying, but I'll be at Moe's.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I gave Mr. Burns the best years of my life. And how much respect does he give me?,,,,,

Homer Simpson,Fine. I'll go sleep with someone who does appreciate me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That was a muffin!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I get it. Your stupid husband is too ""drunk"" to do it right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, so you don't like it when I drink. What other secrets have you been hoarding to use against me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I didn't realize you've been counting the years. Is it that horrible living with me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It is to me! Marge, I can't live like this! I'm tired of walking around on eggshells.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now you're just making up rules. Who made you Judge Judy and executioner?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kids, sometimes when a daddy learns that a mommy always hated him, he needs some time away to think.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no. This is nothing like Milhouse's parents. Now if you need me I'll be staying with Milhouse's father.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You don't have a doorknob.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do I dare to go up? Or is the love that waits behind that window just a lie?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stupid Flanders with his misleading silhouette. Well, I guess I have no choice but to go back home and... hey, I never noticed that newspaper box.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Apartment Finder: We put you in your place."" ""Roommate wanted for three bedroom apartment. Spacious, river view, only four hundred dollars a month!"" Thank you, news box... It's gone!",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"What's the deal with this place? It's so manly, yet scented.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nice to meet you, Stuart.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Me too. I'm a member of this club where if I eat one more sub sandwich, I get a free sub sandwich. You probably saw the ads, with this guy who used to be fat, but now he's just ugly.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you trying to tell me that you guys are those guys that like guys?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You are? Hm, which will win out? My old-fashioned prejudices or the fact that I've already mixed my laundry with yours. I'll have to sleep on it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You guys lead a fascinating life. Like, why are you reading the New York Times? You don't live in New York.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Calm down, Picky Ricardo. He made us a great breakfast, and you're just ridin' his butt... and not in a good way.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, get used to it, 'cause I'm gonna stay.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Way ahead of you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I see.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, please. Let's not fight in front of the kids. Just secretly hate me the way you always have.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You noticed! I've been using LancÃ´me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'd better go. But before I do, Marge, there's something I want to ask you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How much do you tip a leg waxer? I need to know by tomorrow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The kids are cool, but Marge is still judging me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Maybe it is. I used to look at Marge and get the same tingle you guys get when you see Rip Taylor. But now, I don't know what's gonna happen. C'mon, let's dance.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Tennessee Williams?! But how did he survive in the world of theater?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Weird Al Yankovic!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Did you ever get the parody songs I sent you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Which one was better: ""Livin' La Pizza Loca"" or ""Another One Bites The Crust""?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, like you and Allan Sherman.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It would take a man of stone with a funny bone of steel to resist that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know... date a chick with kids...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, all right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute... Marge likes a little bit of stubble.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh. Gotta even it out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Margarita... that's Mexican for Marge. I'll take that as a sign!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I've learned a lot living here. It doesn't matter what someone's sexual preferences are, unless they're a celebrity, in which case it's dish, dish, dish!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You guys don't have a gay time machine, do you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I gotta go.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry I'm late -- the Velvet Mafia made me a Margarita I couldn't refuse.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But it was Marge. My first and only love. I'm like David Spade without Chris Farley, alone and useless!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow. Wow. I never realized you felt about me that way. We should really take some time to talk and...I'd just end up hurting you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, Moe, I was just thinking. My problems with Marge started because I drink too much. And then tonight alcohol only made things worse. Maybe all of my problems are actually caused by...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah. The night that destroyed my marriage.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You have that on tape?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, she didn't hate me. She married me because she loved me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I never want to be apart from you again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That is the best kiss I've had tonight.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Manly thoughts.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Those suck. They're worse than nothing. I could write way better songs.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Coming, sweetie!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can you shoot one where I'm Rambo and my wife is Betty Boop?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You people are guests in our country, and the beaver have no right to treat you that way. If I get back your land, will you promise to build a casino on it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How many decks will your blackjack dealers use?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Three.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Deal. My brother...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, son, we just knock over this dam and the noble Native Americans can reclaim the land that is theirs.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,Stop shoving! The little one isn't getting any.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,/ Let's see move that there... do a flanking maneuver there... Wind should be coming in from the south... Time it to coincide with a beaver holiday...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This map is useless! Useless!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's the beef hormones and the fluorescent lights. What are you gonna do?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Check it out, beavers. Delicious motel furniture!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh! We forgot to empty the mini-bar!,,,,,

Homer Simpson,Who is he?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Woo hoo! In your face, imaginary guy!",,,,,

Homer Simpson,Where is your mother? I've gotta get to Moe's.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Public transportation is for jerks and lesbians. I guess I'll walk.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stupid walking, thighs chafing horribly, no drink holder. I miss my car so much -- everyone's driving but me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I did it. I walked all the way to Moe's from my house.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, I feel pretty good. Maybe I should just keep walking instead of going into a dark, dreary bar.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No. From now on, walking is my beer. And feeling good is my hangover.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, all this walking is paying off -- look how healthy I am.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You see? I'm finally thin enough to wrap this thing around my arm.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You see? Before, I probably would have driven to the syrup.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Calm down, Stresserella!",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Sorry, I got a lot on my mind.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There's Homer... Homer J. Simpson... and Commander Cool, a/k/a me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We've gotta help her. If Marge isn't happy, I'm not happy. And if I'm not happy Moe is very happy. But for once, this isn't about Moe. What should I do, Dr. Hot Dog?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You mean... like give her full custody of the kids?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I see. Do you have any suggestions?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Here's a dollar.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gotta go.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm gonna treat Marge to a romantic dinner, to make up for all my shortcomings.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,Why you little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, let's all raise our wine boxes... to Marge!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're welcome. And now Marge, we cooked, you clean.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,Five-H?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, these freaks do a lot of cool stuff. ""Cookouts, hayrides, bowling...""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You mean like some sort of madman?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll do it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I will now give each of you your specially selected tribal name.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Let's see. What Native American activities should we do? Making wallets... faking crop circles... respecting nature... jeez, no wonder these guys lost the Civil War.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The noble Chiefs outsmarted the treacherous Cowboys with a seven-yard screen pass. Unfortunately, after further review, the great father in the sky determined that the receiver's moccasins were out of bounds. I shall bet no more forever.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Without the talking stick, we don't hear you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But I was chosen by the Great Spirit to teach these young braves the ways of the antelope and the ear of corn... which we call maize... that the papoose... eh, I'll be at Moe's talking normal.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, treadmill! How do you like this incline?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, I'm giving it back to the earth.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you were an excellent peace-time Chief. But these times call for men of cruelty.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it's too tight! Take it off! Take it off! Take it off!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Men of cruelty.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, Bart. Back up the truck.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's laxative-free for today's lifestyle!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute. How could those stupid jar-heads win?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well I'm not finished. Where does it say we have to be gracious in defeat?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, remove that stitching.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,People will do anything a sign tells them.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, that slaked my thirst.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Or did it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You talk pretty tough for a man without health insurance!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my God, that's my wife, and she's crying.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How come Lisa always gets to pick the family activities?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's because there were seven apostles.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, that's a big staff. And still he wasn't that funny.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid prey. They never suspect anything.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooo, a hotdog!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Flower power my ass.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So long, suckers!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo-hoo! Pedal to the metal!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Your baby!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,NOOOOOOOOOO!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Moe! Thank God you saved my baby...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, Maggie's in the paper with Moe. How cute.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look at those pants. They're standing up with no one in them.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my God, I'm late for work.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's Patty, chump!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, it's great that she's got a father-figure in her life. She--hey wait, that's supposed to be me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No way! I'm not gettin' my fingerprints on that train wreck. But if I lose Maggie, I'm oh-for-three. I've gotta get her back.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I said, pipe down, Amtrak.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Back off, Moe. Maggie wants to be with me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is how we play. THE SQUIRMY WORMY SPIDER / SQUIRTS OUT OF DADDY'S HANDS...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,... DADDY FEELS REJECTED / HE'S GONNA EAT SOME CAKE.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I recorded that for private use!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Your turn.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Moe?! What are you doing here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's it, Moe. This is just too weird. You are not allowed to see Maggie anymore.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Get your own family, Moe.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get out!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get out!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah. You know, looking at this sweet precious child makes me want to have one of our own.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What are you screaming about? Did you discover my snake farm? 'Cause I can explain. I'm going to farm and sell snakes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It must have been Moe!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thank goodness.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, no, that was me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll get our little passports.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my God, I've gotta save her!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We're not. Your sleeve got caught on that tree. Here, let me unhook ya.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Off you go.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Or worse, am I right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe, I was just thinking, if Maggie and I were in the neighborhood, maybe we could drop by and have a playdate with you... and your ham.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You kids have got to learn that actions have consequences! Eat fire, punks!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Never!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Beat the lumps. Beat the lumps. Beat the lumps.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Death? We don't want any.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is for Snowball One and JFK!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Does this mean they'll never cancel the Jim Belushi Show?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nooooo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Death, Death, we miss you so much. You were a busboy in the restaurant of life, clearing away the oldies and the sickies and the chokies. And you made NASCAR racing exciting.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll curb him... without enthusiasm.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooo, this robe's pretty soft.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Check it out! I finally found a dead guy's clothes that fit me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What? It's not... My hand! What's happening?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No way. Forget it. I might occasionally kill out of anger, or to illustrate a point, but I am not a Grim Reaper.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow! I'll reap! I'll reap already!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Jasper, your time has come!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Never mind. I'm Death now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Leave everything to me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Pardon me, comin' through, rest in peace, you're dead... Take an dirt nap. Feed the worms...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hm.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'unno.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, who am I giving the finger to today?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not this! Anything but this!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... what was that first one again?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay God, I bumped off the love of my life, according to your divine whim. Now release me from this ghastly vocation.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Come on!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo-hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm gonna not kill you every week.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Y'ello?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The Nobel Prize! Finally. So, uh it's for what, my whole deal?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If I say no, do I still win?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I wish I was Death again. That was cool.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmm...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't go on...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It was those guys!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just one of life's mysteries, like why is my nose jammed full of army men?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let the baby have her bottle.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lisa!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, that's good! Stop there!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, she must have some kind of super-chore in there! Like getting the rat out of Maggie's room!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This counts as a bath!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whom? Whom?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, you're not at school. Don't swear!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Honey, this is your moment in the sun. And I couldn't be more pleased for your happiness.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why was I born?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh T-shirt. Bless the loom that fruited you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gotta win a T-shirt. Gotta win a T-shirt.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, get ready to laugh!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cranford Man Missing. What's he missing? His pants? A train? Gimme a break!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Too soon, huh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right. ""Drought threatens to turn west into dessert""? Yum, yum. I think I'd like some whipped cream on my Wyoming!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"From what, too much hot fudge? Huh? C'mon Bart, show me some love!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is what happens when I go for six hours without sleep.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Peace talks break down."" No. ""For sale, Ford Festiva..."" I'll put that in the ""maybes."" I gotta get that T-shirt.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,World's Biggest Pizza?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my God!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, wake up! The newspaper is talking to me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I wish! Look at this headline.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Someone, or something, knows I love oversized food and short, punchy articles. So they hid a message in the first letter of each line. See: ""HOMER, MEET ME 4TH STREET OVERPASS, MIDNITE.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute. This is today's paper. That meeting is tonight!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I don't know what this is, but sometimes you've just gotta go with your gut.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, I will.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's why I don't listen to my brain. And away we go!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Psst. Hey pal. Hey buddy. Wake up. Wanna go on an adventure with your old man?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You have no choice.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,There's coffee in the thermos.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,They all do.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, the bathroom's a block away.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mom? You're back. Just like you were back before, then you left me again. I love you so much, but it's so hard for me to trust you. Oh, what the heck.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Give me a hug, you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I know! I'm working my way up to you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think the government has better things to do than to read my mail.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You sure know me, Mom.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I made this when I was five. I had to do something -- your pencils were all over the place.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Cora, is there a back way outta here?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mom, I swear on your eventual grave I will never, ever, let the police get their hands on you. Uh-oh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, I'm not a man who's good with words...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I barely know my mother. And every time I see her, she's taken away again. And when a man doesn't have his mother, he winds up like me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I mean, I'm due back in this same courtroom three times today. Hell, I torched a blood bank. One cookie my ass! Please, please, give me back my mommy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Mom, I'm so happy! I never want to let you go!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! I can be a little boy again!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A boy who gets some on the side.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dad, you testified against her!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look Mom, look! I'm riding by myself!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You weren't around for the birth of your grandson, and I want you to see it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey guys, I brought my Mom.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Welcome to your room, Mom. I want you to stay here forever.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now get out of my house.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No! I can't lose my mother again! Don't take her away!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How do you figure?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're right. People should only be let out of jail on technicalities.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Candlepin bowling? That's a great idea. We'll play right after I break your grandmother out of prison.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, boy. Flip through those highway warnings 'til we find one that'll stop that bus.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Next.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pass.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bo-ring.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Awww.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Haw haw, loser!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Geez, pal.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mom, I love you! I can't let you go to prison!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, stop it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Take care, ladies. I'm sure you can make it back to the prison on your own.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mom, I'm gonna hide you where there's no one around for miles... Disney's California Adventure.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, you're my mother and I won't leave you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, that did mess me up pretty bad. But I'm not gonna leave you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, that's lucky.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Brambles! Briars!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Go Mom! You can do it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nooo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bear?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Your last act as a mom was to make me a better dad. But at least now I'll never lose you again.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I couldn't sleep, because I thought there might be a sign of my Mom in one of these articles. They never did find her body.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Last week's garbage. I missed the pick-up date. But it doesn't matter, because my Mom is alive. See?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I-M-O--,i-m-o--,1",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"--K"". Get it? ""I am OK.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh boy, casino night! Finally, they'll teach our kids the dangers of doubling down on a six.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw Marge, I bet you've gotten that out of your system.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll put everything on lucky seventeen.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo-hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I win!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This is it, baby. First thing tomorrow, we're getting a Playstation One!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'd like to cash in these chips. Give me most of it in cash and the rest in suitcases to carry the cash.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I'm up two hundred thousand dollars! Give me my money!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You think I won't manhandle a little boy?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why don't you start a rumor that he's...ding-a-ling-a-ling hello-oo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, what a delicious quiche! I drive a pink Miata.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"La, la, la...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My name is Nelthon! I use a thalad fork. La-dee-dah! I wash my face!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Clothesline.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I wish I'd married a businessman. Then I'd have nice things.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'm so confused.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"On my chess set, the pawns are all Hamburglars.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, you've got to stand up to these guys. And when you do, people will remember you. Just look at these postage stamps.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,There's Bugs Bunny... Fat Elvis... Autumn in New England... Bats of the Southwest... all heroes. Wanna see Elvis kiss a bat? Hey baby come here lemme kiss you...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Squeak, squeak, squeak. No, don't kiss me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No way! I'm saving for a speedboat!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm not driving forty-five minutes a day! You can't go to that school!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why can't you have a normal dream, like being an Olympic figure skater?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you crazy? I'm not getting up at six-thirty every morning so you can prance around a frozen pond and think you're better than me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'unno. How 'bout a horse whisperer?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Over my dead body!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,One thousand dollars. Do you know how much furniture we could rent with this?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, this is why people don't tell you things.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, we put up a flyer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You know the drill. Try to land on my back-fat.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can you describe the bill?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,IT'S BART'S MOON PARTY FROM OUTER SPACE...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We've gone on plenty of great vacations.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I still don't know why you had that photo enlarged.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'd like to return to Brazil. But I hear the monkey problem is even worse now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'll be on my best behavior -- you have my word as a gentleman and a lady. Now let's see, which rifle should I bring?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Would an American dollar encourage you to leave us alone?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The place I was born is now a gator farm.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow. I can't believe we met Mr. Bean.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Make with the tea, Jeeves.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We're bigshot tourists from everyone's favorite country: the USA. We saved your ass in Vietnam and shared our prostitutes with Hugh Grant. So give me some free maps, and none of that dry British wit.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thank you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw Dad, I wish there was something I could do.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Touch that mini bar and you're dead!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fish? I don't know, I'm not really a vegetarian...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, Marge, you've gotta admit. I've been on my best behavior this trip.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That was over soccer results! Can you believe they gave Giggs a yellow card in the box?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I understand the word ""gave."" Unless it means something else in this country.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, now, let's just look... there's Big Ben, there's Piccadilly Circus, there's Jimmy Page, one of the greatest thieves of American black music who ever walked the earth. Bup, there's the kids.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You can't bet on my kids. This is America, pal!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What? What play?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You mean ""Macbeth""?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What? By saying ""Macbeth""?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Saying what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Macbeth, I'm really sorry.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But please, find it in your jewel-encrusted heart to forgive me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, this trip is entirely uneventful.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I see an opening.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's it. I'm acting the way America acts best -- unilaterally.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, I'm gonna go over there and see if they're cool.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, let's see. Oh, you can buff that out, you can buff that out, that's factory error, that thing's supposed to be on fire...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lady, please. Get back in your overturned car. Let the guys handle this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Your Majesty?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The Queen of whaaa?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait! We have to exchange insurance!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Back cuts?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"My Lord, we Americans love queens, be they homecoming or Dairy. This woman, however, is an imposter.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Her luggage is inscribed ""H.R.H."" -- which means her real name must be... Henrietta R. Hippo.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Your Honor, I've completely disappointed my wife. That's punishment enough. You understand these things, you're a grandmother.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ohh, and a very manly one, if I may say so, m'lord.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, she's good. If she were a hundred years younger... and I were a hundred years older...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,America rules! Our Beatles are way better than your precious Rolling Stones!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Marge, I Am so sorry. I should've listened to whatever it was you were saying.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well Marge, if I die here, there's one thing I want you to remember: don't buy any videotapes in England. They won't work in our VCR!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dear God of England: please let me go. In return I will spell the word ""color"" with a ""u"" and I'll use the metric system with every cubic milliliter of blood in my... oh, I can't do it. It's so stupid!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A secret tunnel? I don't know. Won't that get me in more trouble?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, what do I do?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sweet freedom, here I--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, it's a good thing I'm leaving before I went nuts. Goodbye Sparkly Elves.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, a Krispy Kreme would really clean up down here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, this place is amazing. It's fit for a Duke, or even an Earl...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Please, your Majesty, I know that I, like many other Americans, have behaved like a total buffoon.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But we Americans are England's children. I know we don't call as often as we should, and we aren't as well-behaved as our goody two-shoes brother Canada, who by the way has never had a girlfriend, I'm just sayin'.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Only my hairdresser knows for sure.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"See ya in Atlanta, jerk!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lady, you're gorgeous. You make Dame Edna look like a dude!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, Mother's Day gift check. Let's see what you got.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Flow... yeah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, we made her the same thing!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kids, we're going Mother's Day shopping! I'm glad this holiday only comes every four years.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Let's see, what would she like?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Twenty on the trifecta?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Her wedding china back?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I could get Marge a new window, just like this one.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, I love Sprawl-Mart. They've got everything. Even Christian videos with talking vegetables.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mmm, Moses.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How dare you challenge my perceptions of what old people can do?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, it's impressive. But I still haven't found the perfect gift for Marge. Only imperfect stuff for me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, well, if it isn't Fatty and Smell-ma.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow! I never thought I'd say this, but you slags are all right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you're gonna love my present. It is so thoughtful it makes the kids' gifts look like crap.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whoa, Marge, get a room!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmm, dare I pour caramel over the cotton candy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is eighty-five pounds of tooth-melting sugar. Dig in!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's it, kids. Suckle Daddy's sugar ball.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's my old lady.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ants!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Birds!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cats!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Flanderses!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Maybe you're right, Marge. Or maybe you're right, candy ball. No, Marge. Then again... No, Marge. Definitely Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Goodbye, old friend. I'll think of you whenever I have a stroke or a heart attack.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my God, I'm gonna be killed by a bear! Well, I guess I don't have to worry anymore about the dangers of smoking.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Smooth.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, please. I'm too upset to talk about it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I did a lot of stuff today. I went to Starbucks, but you didn't see that on tape.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Choke on your candor!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's a deal!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hello? Anyone home?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge? Maggie?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""The Bear Went Over The Mountain""?! ""The Berenstain Bears""?! Ahhh, Goldilocks... and the Three Bears!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh God, they're in our food! Teddy Grahams, Gummi Bears...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you a Care Bear?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why does a bear need a crowbar?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, go ahead.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can I fight human-style? By slowly poisoning his environment until he loses his fur and becomes sterile?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You cowardly Swede! You face that bear like a man, or I'll never speak to you again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But how will I find out what you had for lunch in nineteen twenty-eight?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Finally, science has joined forces with revenge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lookin' good. And I did it all without wasting money on one of those stupid welder's masks.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Check it out, ladies. The suit that makes me completely invulnerable to bear attack.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know. If I get really scared, I don't want to ruin the suit.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Rub a dub dub, I'm washin' the blub.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What kind of an example would I be if I didn't take revenge on things?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, the point of Moby Dick is ""be yourself.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine. But do you know how ridiculous you look right now?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you awake? Marge?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Gentlemen, sometimes a man must put his marriage at risk for reasons that are confusing even to him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No way. If something happens to me, you have to carry on the Simpson name.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That is so cool. All right, you can come.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I never realized how hot this suit is. I'm sweating out all my blood-lust!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Suh-weet.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my God! Lenny! Carl! Bart?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I guess this is it. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die a man.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is this thing hurting you?,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Okay, it's probably the tag. But just to be sure...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you're not mean. It was just this tag that made you go ape-scat. We're not so different. Give me a hug.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Jeez! I don't know why bear hugs enjoy such a great reputation.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's funny.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh no, the hunter has become the hunter!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,He must be following this thing. Well I'm gonna make sure it never harms another living creature.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wrong again, liberal media.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, I'll find you someplace safe.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, you wanna go over there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hold on. Something doesn't feel right.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait! Stop! I know bullets can be scary sometimes. But I have an idea. First we pull off all of your fur.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, all right I'm still thinking!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"They're looking for a male bear, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's so easy to condemn, so hard to create.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What can I say? I love nature...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Circle of life.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,BAH-DAH-DAH DAH-DAH DAH-DAH DAH-DAH DAH-DAH...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,TIME TO WHIZ IN A FOAMING BOWL OF CHINA...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A line for the bathroom? What gives?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, can I have cuts?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sweet.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now calm down. I'll just unlock it with this coat hanger.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh God, it's baby blood!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart! You're not hitting hard enough!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The door? Now I'll never get to pee.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You just lost a box, pal!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, well uh, funny thing about that...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"On our way to the clinic, I decided to give him a night his wang would never forget.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wanna play some air hockey?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're on!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I can't neuter you, boy. Not after all we've been through.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But from now on, you better save your lovin' for the couch cushions!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You broke our deal -- we had an oral contract!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm your man!,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Welcome to the Homer Simpson Show. I'm your host, Next Card. Homer Simpson it's great to be here in Next Card. Springfield my guests are...Moe Szyslak, local businessman, Carl Carlson, raconteur, and Lenny Leonard, three-time juror. Gentlemen, what's on your minds?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ever notice how seats are too small for normal-looking guys like me? Theaters... airplanes... why even here. Look!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who has more power? Miss America or Miss U.S.A.?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why so formal, Lenny? You're my go-to guy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Interesting...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Please welcome new panelist, Barney Gumbel.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Please welcome my newest panelist, Disco Stu.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My pleasure.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So did I, son. And look where I am today.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, everybody loves my show.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, you're right...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Duck, Mr. Lincoln!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I took Bart's advice last week, so I guess it's Lisa's turn. Now, if you'll excuse me...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You hit him high, I'll hit him low!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Y'know, we've had a great time on this show ""riffing"" on small, unimportant subjects.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, that's all over now. From now on, we will focus solely on important issues.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Every year the gulf between rich and poor nations gets larger. Yet, the IMF insists on unrealistic debt-repayment schedules.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why should America consume ninety percent of the world's resources? Argentina must devalue her currency to pay her debts!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You can't leave, I'm your ride home!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll audience you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I thank God every day you settled for me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, where's my car?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Will you make my sundae for me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm hungry. Are they married yet?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then whose garter is this?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I love the holiday season.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"See you in spring, toes!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my God! A DVD player.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Carl, you remembered I like TV!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yes, I am... your present is right in the other room.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on machine, take my dollar!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fine, we'll play it your way.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here you go, Lenny.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"May the spirit of Retsin be with you all year long. God bless God, amen.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh c'mon... Mr. Burns is way more selfish.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That evil old bone bag... smelling of death... nose like a vulture... followed everywhere by that kiss-ass Smithers...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Joe DiMaggio?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I need money for Christmas... can I get anything for this Joe DiMaggio baseball card? It's kinda old.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thank you! Freak.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, everybody! We're going shopping at the Springfield Heights Promenade!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"First we'll buy gifts for each other. Then we'll spend the rest of the cash on a Christmas tree so large, its absence from the forest will cause mudslides and flooding.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Doing pretty good so far. A key ring for Marge, key ring for Bart...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That thing for me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh God, it's so unnecessary!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm upside down so much!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, if I buy this, I won't have anything left for a Christmas tree...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's the birthday I'm always forgetting. I must have it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, sure, you know it. The biggest tree from the finest lot in town!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's fine. Everyone just relax, lock your doors, don't make eye contact with anyone and listen to the radio.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Exactly.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Gorgeous, huh? And quite the bargain.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it just needs a little love.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why do the things I love always burn?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Isn't it sufficient.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... Woo hoo! Maggie's talking!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There's a trickle-down theory here. If I'm happy, I'm less abusive to the rest of you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, this is sadder than ""Tuesdays With Morrie.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon Marge, I'm not the only selfish person. You have to get your hair done at ""Supercuts."" I guess regular ""Cuts"" just isn't good enough for you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's not true. I cared what you thought once you found out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can't you yell at me now and get it over with?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't need her, I've got you, Astrolabe.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Jimmy Stewart as a puppet is just wrong.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mr. McGrew! I love that blind, senile old man.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I heard you the first five times.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh McGrew. Once again you've mistaken something for something!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my God! It's like looking at a cartoon version of myself.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, Death. Leave McGrew alone. Take Tiny Tim.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Unloved by Al? Noooooooo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Unloved by all! Noooooooo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Children, children, what day is this?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thank God! There's still four more days 'til Christmas. I have time to reform my ways!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I just saw the greatest cartoon of all time. It was about a miser who was visited by three ghosts at Christmas. And get this: he learns a lesson!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, TV and nightmares have joined forces to teach me a lesson. From now on, I will stop being selfish and start being good. In fact, I'll be the nicest man in town.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, but this time I'm sober. Ish.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No need, Flanders. I've already given them my old clothes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Good-lookin' group.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're welcome!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, Lenny. I know I was a pretty bad Secret Santa, so I wanted to make it up to you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And I filed down all the sharp corners. See, your eye is completely safe.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, do you want this last pork chop?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, now you're startin' to creep me out.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm not looking for glory or wealth. I'm just buying that stairway to heaven Jesus sang of.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Get back to your bong, hippie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just like the Pope!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Being unselfish is a natural high, like hiking or paint thinner.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And here's another act of Christian charity I pulled out of my butt.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I built a skating rink for the whole town!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here's your skates. Oh, you'll have to take off those boots.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ewww.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pathetic Flanders. Thinking he can buy people's love with thoughtful gifts.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll show Flanders. I'm gonna get everyone a car. What's that one good American car?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... is it despair?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmm. You've given me a lot to think about.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I've got it... when everyone's asleep, I'll take away their presents. Then they'll be happy! Thanks, Buddha.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"YOU'RE A HERO, HOMER J. / YOU'RE AS CRAFTY AS A SKUNK / THEY'LL THANK YOU IN THE MORNING FOR STEALING FLANDERS' JUNK / HOMER JAAAAAY! / You're a double-bacon genius-burger... AND JUST A LITTLE DRUNK.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now to hear the joyous sound of people waking up on Christmas to discover they have no presents.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"They don't sound happy... but here comes a mob, shaking their fists in gratitude.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um, shouldn't you all be singing carols or something?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute, everyone! There's your Christmas up there!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Let's just say that on this day, a million years ago, a dude was born who most of us think was magic, but others don't, and that's cool. But we're probably right. Amen.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And now, I think the only thing left to do is -- return all your gifts! Ned?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, Maggie! Funny Daddy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Too hard.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Give Daddy the remote, Maggie. Give daddy the...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh. Wise guy, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nyagh-nyagh-nyagh-nyagh-nyagh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop! Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You can't change the rules in the middle of the game! We never would have had these kids if we'd thought we had to pay for 'em. Promises were made!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then why did you appear in it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maybe she was you and you're not! How many kids do we have?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wrong, lady! Oh wait, the baby.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Honey, this marriage is a partnership. When you fall, I pick you up. And when you can't finish a sandwich, I eat that sandwich.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I promise this rock is gonna weigh you down for the rest of your life.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Honey, no one messes with my Mrs. I'll come down on those guys like the garage door on Bart's bike.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You just leave everything to Homer. And now, I believe you owe me half a sandwich.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here comes my commercial. In six, five, four...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You've probably heard a lot of bad things about Families Come First.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But newspaper writers are a bunch of jerks. Who really opposes ""Families Come First?""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Many childless advocates are like Ben Affleck -- famous, successful people from out of State!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They live in fancy houses in other places.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Families Come First"" is supported by lifelong Springfieldians you know and trust like me, Milhouse's Dad, Bumblebee Man, Surly Duff, and that jerk that goes ""Yeees!""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"For more information, visit our website, www.al-jazeera.com. We're not affiliated. We're just piggybacking on their message board.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I am Rudy Giuliani. Do as I command you. I am Rudy Giuliani. Do as I command you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Either way. The important thing is the system works.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Great. Let's dump these kids in an R-rated movie while we go someplace nice.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, wait.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I am Rudy Giuliani. You must forgive Homer. I am Rudy Giuliani. You must forgive Homer. I am.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What do I care?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, that creepy kid's here!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A ten-speed bike?! What did your mother say?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm confused! Which is it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, the kitchen lady's right -- no new bike while your old one still works.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's right. No questions asked.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There, there. You're both right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, would you like to ride your new bike out of the store?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"For true, son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Here we go. Now it starts with the fees.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll assemble it myself.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can make a bike. I made you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, that's gonna win you a lot of bar bets some day.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh man, this is so confusing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the Hell is this?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bike's over there.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Son are you okay? I brought my home-made first aid kit. It's spring-loaded for quick access!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"First of all, thank you. Secondly...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There's nothing worse than the look on a boy's face when he says ""Dad I don't think you can build a fully-functional robot.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Robot, I command you: do something cool!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I could quit now... but then my son will never look up to me. Why was I born a Dad?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why... do... I... suck?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute. What is it my Dad always said to me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, the beer's gone. I'll have to suck it out of the shag.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Like a dog. Or a snowman!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""...I'd love to be with you, but I just remembered an old army buddy has come to town. Will meet you later. Love, Dad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Doin' it for the boy...doin' it for the boy... pain is love... to bleed is to care...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Woo hoo! I mean, beep beep!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pretended.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Various bug bites and wounds. Now stop interrupting your brother.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I like you, son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not so rough, Bart. Daddy can't handle so much love right now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I've been busy, son. They really need me over at the nuclear plank.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't think so, son. But on the other hand, I may be closer than you think.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So much metal in my eye.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh no! My recurring nightmare is coming true!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There are many people I'd like to thank for this award. My wife, Anjelica Huston -- this is for you, Angie! We did it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen son, there's something I have to tell you about our robot.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I just installed a chip that makes it ten per cent more bloodthirsty!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And if anything happens to me, I want you bullies to take care of my boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I wish I had bullies like you growing up.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You think you've got problems, look what I just pulled out of my arm!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's what we in the business call ""a biggie.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The business of being a Dad. Can you hand me that magnet?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can you do my back?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, I'm sorry -- I could never build a robot this awesome. I'm a fraud.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Affirmative.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You really think so?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I'm the luckiest--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what gives? He's not killing me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,He knows just how I like my martinis... full of alcohol.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, all that button ever did was send a mild electric shock up my backside.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Keep me focused.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, did you ever suspect it was me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, I'm pretty unreliable.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Let's see... I'll have sixteen gravy scrape 'ems, a bucket of twisty lard, and two super-choker breakfast burritos with macho sauce. And mega-size it, please.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Great. And I'll have a diet coke. Deep fried.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmm... need more lap.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't see! I'll have to steer by the reflection in my watch!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why don't I just pull over?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's stuck! Krusty collectible toy jammed under brake pedal!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh no! I hit the grief counselor!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I had a car!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I gotta get a job before Marge finds out I was fired.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's it! I'll steal this sign and they'll pay me to make them a new one!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We'll clean out those stupid Americans.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...you probably want to talk this over, so I'll leave you two ""alone."" Excuse me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They'll be back.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He was my best friend.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Cool, an ambulance from the '60s! I bet a lotta hippies were denied care in this thing. Injured hippies!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll do it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Guess what? I quit my job as a used car salesman.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Get with the program, Marge. Your husband is now an ambulance driver!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maybe on planet ZooZoo.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kids, kids. Those aren't your toys. They're to keep Daddy asleep and awake.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm gonna need them on my first shift tonight.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Slow down, Picasso! You were gonna start a novel without informing me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I also fed some ducklings.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fine, fine. I'll take the kids tonight, and you go to your precious hair appointment.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whatever. But I think you look great already.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Where to, Mack?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hospital, eh? Wow, everyone's goin' there tonight.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why don't you admit I know it's around here somewhere?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm back!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I need some dinner, stat! And the kids need some CPR lessons.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll say.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh good, you can use that to take down my dinner order. I'll start with the soup, then a nice mixed grill with a side of wild rice.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge! We're out of bath towels.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, ice cream truck!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,HERE IN MY CAR / I AM HOSING OFF BLOOD / SOME OF IT'S MINE / BUT MOST OF IT'S NOT / HERE'S MARGE...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, typed!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No problem.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Two hundred and eighty-six pages!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! I'm half-way through!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, ""Chapter One."" Hm, that makes sense. ""There once was a girl from Nantucket..."" Good, good... ""Her name was Temperance Barrows and her heart was heavy with feeling. She...""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No! Gotta read Marge's book. Can't get distracted. Hm... ""distracted,"" that's a funny word. Does anyone ever get ""tracted?"" Let me call the suicide hotline and ask them.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I did.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No! They were all in their own way totally awesome.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"As I've always said: ""publish or perish""!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, how much bleach did you drink? Not a talker, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Apu, do you sell Crazy Straws? I've got a guy with a broken back and I'm tryin' to cheer him up.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What are you talking about?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why do you keep talking that way?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, then maybe I will.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That one I got.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll have to read Marge's book. And I swore never to read again after ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" gave me no useful advice on killing mockingbirds. It did teach me not to judge a man based on the color of his skin, but what good does that do me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The Harpooned Heart. Book on tape! As read by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How can you write such horrible things about me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I didn't lie. I was writing fiction with my mouth.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just tell me how much of this is true!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I knew it! And what about the romance between you and Cyrus?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'll make sure you never imagine anything again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Flanders!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Open this door right now!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What are you doing here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Flanders, pull over! I'm an ambulance!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Flanders, I'm gonna do something I shoulda done a long time ago.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Would you help me be a better husband?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,In Marge's book I was so mean and you were so nice. How can I be more like you? Just give me some advice.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-huh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why would I rub her back unless I wanted to get some... oh, to make her feel good.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's right. I love you Marge, and I realize now I should show you more often. The end of your book was the wakeup call I needed after falling asleep at the beginning of your book.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry about those losers, Marge. I think it's time we went home and collaborated on a little project of our own.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I've got it all figured out: Lee Harvey Oswald wanted to steal the Jack Ruby.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, we're back to square one. Put on some coffee.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I was so close.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All I know is the guy who played Mozart was also in ""Animal House."" Now there's a movie with good music. ANIMAL HOUSE HOUSE HOUSE... / NOBODY EVER WENT TO CLASS... / THEN WE SAW DONALD SUTHERLAND'S ASS... / ANIMAL HOUSE HOUSE HOUSE... /",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"ROLLIN', ROLLIN', ROLLIN' / TOXIC BARREL ROLLIN'",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"To old man Burns, who's paying us to drink because we're embarrassing!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A lot of that went in my lungs.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's great. I'm honored to drink to Apu and, uh... Apulina.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, Marge and I have an anniversary coming up.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,These charity address labels that came in the mail.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't wanna go home! I'm not done talking to me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Home sweet home. Now to watch some TV.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Five bucks? I don't need your sharity! I'll dance for my money!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I am so wasted. Oh my God, oh my God, we're having a simultaneous pass out!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Loveless loners are so lucky. There's no way I can afford to give Marge a nice anniversary present.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hm...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I know you. We met in a police lineup.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You don't have to tell me, I was number three. Listen, you have any pointers for a newbie?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Coke and Pepsi are the same thing! Wake up, people!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm not gonna lie to you...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,All the answers you need are in here. Happy anniversary!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nope.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nope.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nope.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Close, but no cigar. Just plain diamonds.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I heard if you age them for ten years, they turn to liquor.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, you heard your mother.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,MR. BO-JANGLES / MR. BO-JANGLES / WE'RE ALL BO-JANGLES / WHO KILLED BO-JANGLES? / MAYBE IT WAS YOU...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thank you. Thank you. Remember, my dog up and died. Thank you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I want to get a second house. Closer to work.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, it was all for you. To buy you all the nice things you deserve. The flowers, the earrings, the Bob Seger boxed set, which really only needed to be one disk, but the box was nice...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't understand.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hoo boy, are you in trouble.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"When a woman says nothing's wrong that means everything's wrong. And when a woman says everything's wrong, that means everything's wrong. And when a woman says something's not funny, you'd better not laugh your ass off.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait 'til he puts his unsuspecting butt on that toilet seat.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Where's the ""ee-yow?""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You didn't sit on the toilet!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Butt on bowl, little man!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It doesn't matter!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ee-yow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Joke's on me, is it...?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's old lady Simpson! Run!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uhh... I'll tell you what's goin' on...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,...I'm taking you all out for pancakes!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Either way, everyone who works in the kitchen speaks Spanish.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Apu, what's with the line?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pre-nursery school?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you saying my daughter can't cut it? Just because I owe you fourteen thousand dollars? I'll show you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, Maggie. You're getting into that school!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Which one? Tri-City? Omni-Pay? Insta-Threat? I've beaten 'em all!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm sorry we wasted your time, your Lordship.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Maggie will do just fine. She'll have plenty of money, 'cause she'll marry a grocer...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...Who steals from the till, would ya let me finish? Geez.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm taking you all out for tacos!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo-hoo! I got that one right too!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Go, Seminoles!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So our kids keep getting smarter! If we have another one, it could build a time machine, which we could use to go back in time and not have any kids.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If you can read this you're almost as smart as my baby. I'm slappin' this sucker right over ""Support Our Troops.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Your mother's right, honey. Katie Couric didn't just become the world's most famous dwarf, she escaped from the circus and went for it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That still sounds like the smart kid.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The school sent this dealy over for Maggie. His name is Phonic Frog.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's me. Huh-oh-muh-eh-er!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll be right back.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why do you always take the children and not the fondue sets? Why, Santa, why?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I knew it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh no, the giant is waking up!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hit the red button!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know, we'll use reverse psychology. Maggie, don't press the red button!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Damn it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I've always loved you. Bart, you were a worthy foe.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh good, she's here in time to see us die!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, Marge, you can't say I never take you anywhere.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I think we all learned a lesson today: don't try to be something you're not. Namely, food.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How'd you get in here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Zing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's my baby, jerk.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The Wild Dingleberries?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I am so there!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"How 'bout ""Diet Coke -- the Movie?""... ""President Air Bud: Tail To The Chief?""... ""My Big Fat Greek Salad?""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, well, I am curious to see if those teens lose their virginity. And the wager only sweetens the deal.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What Would Jesus View?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay kids, forget the movie. We'll just go to the furniture store and sit down.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The Re-deadening? Is that any good?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Lenny, is your film appropriate for kids?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't ruin it for me! One adult and four children for ""The Re-deadening.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I paid for this popcorn and I'm eating it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Relax, stupid. Everything you see is make believe. Although it is based on a true story. Some of which happened in this very theater.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh honey, don't be scared. Look, they killed the evil doll.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, what do you know? It's unkillable.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Honey, can daddy rest his soda on your head?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's my girl.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But scaring kids is good for them. It hardens them against future terrors -- like roofing and driveway scams.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry. I forgot I bought the soundtrack album.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Who loves ya, baby?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay. You have the right to remain sexy. Anything you touch can and will be held against you in a court of sex. If you cannot afford a sex-torney--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't see any ghost. I did find this Newsweek from 1986: ""Why America Loves Saddam Hussein.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's it. It's one thing for a ghost to terrorize my children, but quite another for him to play my theremin.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I thought we killed him!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I did delete him from my bulk email list.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah. That monkey got America through some tough times.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No way! He's an annoying sneak who's out to steal my wife.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay kids, you can keep him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, little fella. You're hangin' with me tonight.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Guys, I'd like you to meet Artie Ziff.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll see your fifty cents and raise you one dollar.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And the peanuts in your mouth.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All of them.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Four jacks.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Check it out! I own a multi-national corporation. I always knew some day I'd be a C.O.D.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Investor confidence? Perhaps this affects me -- I own two hundred and thirty million shares of ZiffCorp stock.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I sure am -- with all the inherent legal liability.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't tell my kids I'm going to jail! Tell them I've joined the Blue Man Group! I'm the fat one!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Plead the fifth amend-what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Refuse to answer on the grounds that I what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Inseminate myself? Dudes, I think this guy's comin' on to me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Your majesty, can I go home now?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I miss you guys so much. The smell of Marge's pork chops... the way you kids kiss my ""owies"" when I go boom... This place has become like a prison to me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, it's no use, son. By the time I get out of here you'll be grown. TURN AROUND / TURN AROUND / TURN AROUND AND YOU'RE A YOUNG MAN / AND YOU'RE TOO BIG TO CHOKE.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can I apply my time toward a future crime?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my God! Maggie, you're talking!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Bart, what a man you've become.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't think we've seen the last of Artie Ziff.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man, even I think movie popcorn has gotten too big.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Get your own, mooch.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'm so bored! Maybe I'll clean out my wallet.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, my car insurance expired. Quite a while ago.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's it. From now on I'm not looking forward to anything. Oh my God, tomorrow there's a two-for-one sale on piano benches! I can't wait!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That was you!?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you destroyed my interest in weather!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I know just where to find him. 742 Evergreen Terrace.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He's in the house?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And it's a perfect time... I just got fired again.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, are you sure we should go drinking together? I mean, who am I gonna complain about while I'm drinking?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well yeah, legally. But if we're really best friends, how come we never play hoops?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hm, all right, we'll go on the winery tour. But you'll have to catch me first!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ow, my ankles snapped.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ahh, summer in Tuscany.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Pleasant aroma, rich full body, well-aged... and the wine's not bad either.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I drank this much!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ooh! Can I have my special cup?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh honey, I love to hear you laugh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes you do.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you do a great me, Marge. You gotta show the guys at Moe's.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, we'll have a blast. Kids, while we're out, the TV's in charge. Go to bed when it says.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Two glasses of wine, Moe.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All good points. Sleep tight, my drunken angel.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yep. Your mother and I have become a legendary party couple. Like Scott and Zelda Munster!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Marge -- I gotta break in my ski boots some time.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No problem. We can still have fun without you drinking.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You got it. And when I feel weak, I will draw strength from the Bible.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh. Here comes the gospel according to puke.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, honey. I don't even know if they serve alcohol at this thing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ahh, the Germans. You just can't stay mad at 'em.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You can just nurse it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nurse it! Nurse it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, and you've said that several times now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm in no condition to drive. Wait -- I shouldn't listen to myself. I'm drunk.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay. Remember the rules for drinking and driving. Drive slow but not too slow. Drink some cola to keep yourself alert.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nice work, cruise control.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"In a minute, honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my God! If I get one more D.U.I., they'll take away my license. And what will I leave when I rent rollerblades?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, this is a new low for me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I paid your bail, honey. You're free to go.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But you do believe it, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's my girl!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,She's not coming anymore.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen, Moe. I did something really terrible to someone I love.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, what I did was...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can I have some peanuts?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I can't talk to my wife for twenty-eight days? Sir, she is not an alcoholic! You can't put me on hold! I'll put you on hold!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I AM A LINEMAN FOR THE COUNTY Your call is important to us. Please continue to hold. AND I DRIVE THE MAIN ROAD There are... eight... calls ahead of you. AND THE WICHITA LINEMAN IS STILL ON THE LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LINE!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, Lisa, your suspicions are important to me and will be answered in the order received. MacARTHUR PARK IS MELTING IN THE DARK / ALL THAT SWEET GREEN ICING ROLLING DOWN / SOMEONE LEFT MY CAKE OUT IN THE LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI- LI... LI... LI... LI...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Flanders, can you watch my kids while I'm at the rehab clinic?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My demons and I are closer than ever. Next year we're gonna visit every major league baseball park. I'm just goin' in to bust Marge out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Feed my pets and tape my shows!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm here to deliver a package to Marge Simpson.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dammit!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I have an awful confession to make: you didn't crash that car, it was me. I put you behind the wheel and I'm so, so, so sorry.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I did it out of love. Love of not being arrested. But I realize now that nothing is more important than you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That woman means the world to me. Would it be all right if I read from my Bible?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No wonder they call it ""the good book.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, shut up, Captain Bringdown.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, Marge. For you I'll give up rum-based cocktails. Except mojitos and rum and coke.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right. For you, I will give up all clear liquors.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I only drink that when I'm already drunk.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, anything's possible. With a little help from my Bible.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh no! It's a real one! Noooooo! Why God, why?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where are your clothes for the gentleman who's big and fat?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So many shoppers. Ow! Damn this... ow! Resilient economy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dressing room? Uh oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is it Lenny?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's not all your fault. All these years, I watched you turn our son into a time bomb, and yet I did nothing. So in a way, I too am a victim... of you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I get it. Blame the strangler.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My poor boy is miserable in here. There has to be something I can do to help him.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Interesting. Marge, what does that sign say?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I believe that children are the future -- unless we stop them now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-huh. When does training start?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Put that sissy down!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If you're gonna pick on someone, why don't you pick on someone much bigger than you with a gun?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's right. I got a job here so I can watch over you like a mother hen.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I sure am. Here you go, son. I brought you a lollipop from the guards' lounge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, that's the end of my shift.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"See you Monday. Oh wait, Monday's Martin Luther King Day. I'll see ya when I see ya.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Love you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You just don't understand boys. He's stupid.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Relax, what's the worst that could happen?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No son of mine will be marched down the aisle at the barrel of a ray gun.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let's go.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, I want you to know, no matter what anyone says, there's no shame in being caught alive.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Gina, thanks for showing us the meaning of Christmas.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm changing the batteries in all the remotes. We're all out of triple A's, so I'm gonna whittle down a couple of these D's.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,She sure loves that couch.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, it's your last night of freedom. You gotta have some fun.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, take it easy on Skinner. He's just down 'cause after tomorrow, everything he does is wrong.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What are you trying to tell me, Skinner?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, guess what! Skinner wants to bail on his wedding!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh man, is this awkward. I'm outta here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah Marge, it looks like you got the last perfect man. Oh uh, by the way... can I borrow your car tomorrow? Mine's acting up.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you're the one always bugging me to screw up our marriage.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whatever. The important thing is to get Skinner to that altar. Because once a union has been sanctified by God, it takes at least six months to tear it apart.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Right, naked Duffman?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, I've got a man on the perimeter.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is Fat Load. I'd like to request a new codename.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, Fat Load here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey champ. Ready to take the plunge?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, he's crazy all right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Unkink the hose!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute. I thought you didn't wanna get married.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, Principal Skinner.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Really? Boy, it sucks to be you. Anyhoo, if there's one thing I know, it's how to win back a furious woman. We'll go to her house, and I'll whisper to you exactly what to say.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, if we get your girlfriend back I won't have to.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, just repeat after me. ""Edna, I made a huge mistake and I want you back.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge? Are you helping her?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Which are you saying is dead? Our marriage or our batteries?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shut up! I didn't tell you to say that!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Because I'm successfully married.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why did I take it off? Oh, right. To see if I could skip it across Lake Michigan.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"String quartet, are you tuned up?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And the castrati?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And a one and a two and a...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Give her back to Skinner! A fat bald guy like you... you could have anyone!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, we'll go to the convention, sell my Lois Lane comics, buy some Jimmy Olsens, and stop Edna from making a terrible mistake!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, Marge. We'll get something to eat.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't see Skinner anywhere.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That room has a dry erase board. They could be doing anything in there! Anything.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay Marge, I hear ya. Now that Krabappel has made her decision, it's time to whitewash over our problems.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, the greatest day of my life was the day you and I became one.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Would you marry me again?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And now, Padre, if you would do the honors.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you just agreed to raise the kids Klingon!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, don't go. Just stay here and rot with Grampa.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll right-side you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I say you don't exist!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can I have both?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, seeing sappy movies with a lady has certain ""payoffs.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Exactly.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,WHERE DO I BEGIN? TO TELL THE STORY OF HOW GREAT A LOVE CAN BE...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,THE SIMPLE SOMETHING THAT DUM DEEDLE DUM DEE DEE... / NOW LET'S PUSH PLAAAY!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, we're tryin' to create a mood here, so shut the Hell up!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh, well, I wouldn't be happy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, um, you're not in the mood anymore, are you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We're alone now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What kind of an airline routes all their flights through Nome, Alaska?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Here's your future!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Remember our honeymoon?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, let's do it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We get one weekend to ourselves and we've gotta spend it watching some old geezer's odometer turn over? As the Bible says: screw that!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We don't have boarding passes, but we need to get on that plane for reasons that are utterly insane.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,There's a first class?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And look at me, I'm reading ""The Economist."" Did you know Indonesia is at a crossroads?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It is.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, it's great being here without those children of yours.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And tonight, we'll finally, and romantically, hump.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You keep thinking that!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,COME ON EVERYBODY HAVE SOME SEX-UAL CONGRESS / NOT THE KIND OF CONGRESS THAT CONTAINED PAUL TSONGAS...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I won't let that happen. We have to grab this chance for romance now, or we'll never be alone. Not 'til Lisa's in college and we've lost contact with Bart.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've got a card that can take us anywhere in the world!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Noooo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah, like people in New Jersey have never seen a fat man makin' out. It's on the freakin' state flag.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Occupied!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"At last, we're alone...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And now, my darling, it's finally time for romance. But before the intercourse, the dinner course.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All I wanted was a second honeymoon, and now the floor is made of lava.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I knew if we got up early enough, we could sneak away from Bart and Lisa. Kids don't beat me, I beat kids.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You monsters! You followed us!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Never!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This way!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Quick -- we can hide in here!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Because I was saving that for my birthday. Now, c'mon!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This must be what it's like to be in space.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And yet, I've never been to me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That sliding should stop soon.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This rolling is just temporary.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, that's better. So why do they call this place Niagara Falls anyway?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I guess we'll just have to make love in Heaven. I'll bet it always works up there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you're on my hair. Oh, that's better.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No one does that to my daughter!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Quiet, the commercial's on! If we don't watch these, it's like we're stealing TV.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do I ever!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Would I!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm going to find that golden ticket and win that tour! The only thing that can make bacon more delicious is seeing how it's made!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nope. Just lookin' for that golden ticket.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nope, nothing, nope, nada, the golden ticket! At long last.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Judge a pig competition?... But I'm no super-genius! Or are I?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I know that country!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,USA! USA!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Comely... succulent... clearly had a snout job...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ugh, too eighties.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I've gotta do something! I'll need a disguise.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hold it right there!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You've hurt your last feeling!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I have a funny feeling we will. Wherever people are mistreated, the Pie Man will strike!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whatcha doin', sweetie?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's really sweet, honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, hey, let's turn that frown upside down.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What's wrong, son?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Somebody ought to take him down a peg. Or, should I say, down a pie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Maybe you're right, Lisa. Maybe you're pie. Pie-be you're pie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Comic Book Guy! Don't do the crime if you can't do the key lime!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I think you'd find his filling extremely hot.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Flanders!? He's not man enough to trim my crust. I mean Pie Man's crust. I'm not Pie Man.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is for your show's slight decline in quality over the years!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not so fast, old-time liberal.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No trap can hold Homer Simpson! But I'm not Homer Simpson. I'm the Pie Man. Homer Simpson away! I mean, the Pie Man!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dammit!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Let's see...cartilage, cartilage, muscle, nerve!... artery...bullet.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Pie Man is not your father, little girl. I... murdered your father.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We shall continue this conversation in the pie cave.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Watch it, one more step. Welcome to my secret lair.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So it would seem. Anyhoo, I'll bet this is all a pretty big surprise, huh? Mild-mannered Homer Simpson...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Honorable men can differ. Now what brings you down here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, I'll stop. But what'll I do with these pies?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I was in so deep, I forgot pies were food.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll show him.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I shouldn't.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Or should I?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll keep my promise, honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Since when do I listen to cakes?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're all so wise... I wish I could eat each and every one of you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've run out of pie-related puns!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's not a rubber band, it's a scrunchie!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I already work for you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do I get two paychecks?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I promised my daughter--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nooo! Not community service -- I can't stand helping others! I just can't!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, not him! Anyone but him! I've had my problems with him. Everyone has. But like every monster, he just wants to be loved.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't sleep. I keep thinking about the Pie Man.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What if he started pieing good people? Not because he wanted to, but because he was being blackmailed by his boss?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I'm not. And here's a picture that proves it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,See...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You know I'm not Pie Man.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh come on, she's a little girl.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The Dalai Lama!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't do this in front of Lisa. Why does she have to believe in things?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Please forgive me, talking llama.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No. I won't. There's only one way I can escape from this nightmare.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm telling you, I'm the Pie Man!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah. Let's go home, honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Was it the kiss?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wherever injustice shows its ugly face, I will be there! For I am the Pie Man!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Homer drunk... but how? Hmmm...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eww! I kissed that sad, weird kid!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My beer! You never had a chance to become my urine! Why you little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Simpson, do you think it's appropriate for a ten-year-old boy to steal a beer with intent to kiss?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Permission to treat this witness as hostile.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Actually, Marge... uh... there uh, was someone before you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It was years ago, when I was ten. Back in the '60s, or '50s, or maybe it was the early '70s...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I thought we were gonna play fun games at camp.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I couldn't believe my eye.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"She was the prettiest girl I'd ever seen. Uh... until I met your mother, who made that girl look like a Godzilla made of garbage.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, this is so confusing. I'd like a brief recess.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whee! Recess!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why? Because I only kissed one girl in my whole life? That's still one more than you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm so lame!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, that stinks. But I still get to kiss you, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Think, Homer, think.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm Elvis. Elvis Jagger. Elvis Jagger Abdul-Jabbar.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,There goes a good friend.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It was pretty delicious.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It felt like a cluster bomb wiping out a graveyard full of zombies.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whuh-oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"She sure did. Now if Lisa is finished with her shenanigans, I'll tell you why I didn't show up...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We had just finished our first smooch. And I felt a feeling I'd never felt before:,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Kids love trains.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, have you two longshoremen seen a pretty girl?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,She wouldn't do that -- we shared something special.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I just blew my first chance at true love.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And now that my special girl has heard the truth, I know she'll forgive me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Earth to special girl? You forgive me, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What about now?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What about now?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What about now?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What about now?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm really sorry I hurt you. But I've done way worse stuff since then: there was the gun I hid from you, the time I sued the church, ruining Lisa's wedding in the future... remember that?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's not true! I thought about that girl every day of my life... until I met you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right. This is my memory box. I haven't opened it in thirty years.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, a letter from my old pen pal. Someday I'll write you back, Osama. Ah, here's what I'm lookin' for.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I sure did. I kept it right next to my IBM stock... king.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Because somehow you realized I was a good guy after all?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, anonymous girl who turned out to be Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Here you go.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't forget Maggie!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Doctor! Perform a diagnosis!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cool!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, pass the ketchup. Bart, pass the ketchup!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, sorry, right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, pass the corn. Bart, pass the corn!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Everybody remember that for when his hearing comes back.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,To date!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No one calls me unpatriotic.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, guys.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, cold shoulder, huh? Well, I'll just talk to myself. Hey, how ya doin', Homer? Oh, not too bad, how about you? Oh I'm fine. Your wife was great in bed last night. You keep your hands off my wife! Oh yeah? Well I give her what she needs. And she likes...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Homer, stop it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Even my best friends have left me! I'm all alone!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Y'ello. Appear on your TV show?! Tell our side of the story?! You'll see us there?! Goodbye?! Dial tone?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no, no, let her finish.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, I've learned one thing in this life: to stay out of trouble, just say nothing. Don't rock the boat. Don't even get in the boat.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just buy some ice cream and walk around the pier. But don't go in the bathrooms, they're filthy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Talk about boats! Then when he asks you if you hate this country, you just start crying and pretend you don't.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There there, save your lies for the American public.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What'd you say?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,BUY ME SOME PEANUTS AND CRACKERJACK... / I DON'T CARE IF... OW!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do you get time off for snitching on your cellmates?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bill Clinton? What are you doin' here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, yeah. Next commercial.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who are you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't want to be in any stupid talent show. Not without my Tennessee walking horses.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, people have accused this family of not loving our country. But you can't spell U.S.A. without us... eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,FIFTY STARS AND THIRTEEN STRIPES...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,TO LOVE OUR COUNTRY IS NO CHORE...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We mean it, don't move.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"OKAY, KIDS SHOW OFF YOUR PIPES...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Because if they catch us, we may have to do it again. And this time I want it tight!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What genius put a prison on the middle of an island?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Great, dive in.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm not made of money! We'll swim to Oakland.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, what's the use? Even if they pick us up, we'll go back to jail 'cause they think we hate America. I don't want to end up like Elmo, hanging himself in prison.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And here no one calls me a fat jerk... I'm a gourmand!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, Marge, there's one group that's always welcome in America: immigrants without I.D.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, kids, this is the first chapter of our brand new lives... in America.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Simpson.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, that'll save some time.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, kids, it'll take us a while to assimilate. I'll start out as a cop, and then, with time, become a dirty cop.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart! You promised you'd stop making that comparison.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Per... our... agreement!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If that tree gets too big, it'll ruin the beauty of that rock. We'll lose tourists! And then who will buy my roadside corn?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There's a lot you don't know about me, Marge. A lot that would shock you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now to do something I've never done before -- help out an old man.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here's a poem: ""run fast, or lose your ass""!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, you're grounded for a year.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, three bucks.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Or that lady who wheels Larry Flynt around!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm always happy to help you, sweetie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,He TOSSES a paper and yells out the window.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Extree! Extree! Man driving erratically throws papers out window!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, I can't wait to dance on his grave.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid women drivers.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid women helicopter pilots.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Everyone okay?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,These batteries have to power everything in our house!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"YO, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I WANT, WHAT I REALLY REALLY WANT... WHAT I WANT WHAT I WANT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That was totally worth it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah, she's always trying to improve mankind.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute. Are you trying to get dirt on Lisa?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, if that's your custom.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, she's into Buddhism, whistle-blowing, totally against pollution no matter what I say...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, that loser Milhouse has always had a thing for her. Don't you love it when nerds don't know they're nerds?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm so sorry, honey. I said good things about you too. Check out the Lifestyle section: ""Plastic pearls make the girl.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I can't stand seeing one of my children like this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can still hear her. I'd better do something.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm pullin' an all-nighter for my little girl. Put on a pot of coffee, drink it and start makin' burgers.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""All my daughter ever did was tell people to think for themselves. I may be her father, but when I grow up, I wanna be just like her. Except still a dude.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"See, Lisa? Instead of one Big Shot controlling all the media, now there's a thousand freaks Xeroxing their worthless opinions.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're the only one who won't shut up about it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Trying to get a Frisbee off the roof.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, there's the Frisbee.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And while you're there, can you get my Frisbee off the ledge?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Flanders, have you seen my Frisbee?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"People's deaths, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do me! Do me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, what'd I die of? Too much happiness? Naked girl avalanche?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What kind of bread?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Flanders? Kill me? You never killed anybody... and you're gonna start with the big dog?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Chief, throw me your piece.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, shoot me a new one!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'm so scared. Ned Flanders is pointing a gun at me. You couldn't even shoot me by accident, even if I whacked the barrel like this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Never!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fine, I'll never go back. Starting tomorrow. Today is Lenny's birthday and they're having ice cream cake.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But ice cream cake...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It sure is taking me a long time to reach this button.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Everything's comin' up Homer.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmmm, I wonder if I could blow up Heaven?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cool. You guys got a good buffet up here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're not the boss of me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Please spare me. I'm not a murderer, I'm not. And I've never known the pleasures of a woman... or a proper eating apple!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Shrink ray? Oh, there's always something else to buy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hold on, Maggie! Daddy's coming!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've got her!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Mag... No wait, this is yours.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Captain!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Screw you, doc! I fly from the gut.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bah! Has science ever kissed a woman, or won the Super Bowl, or put a man on the moon? This is what I think of your precious science.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Help me, science!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, that's what turns a mediocre voyage into a fantastic voyage.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maybe this'll help.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,There's a whole rack of 'em over there. I only ate two.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And to make sure we get there super fast, I'm hitting all the buttons with my palm.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We'll have to lighten the ship, which means one of us has to stay behind. Bart?... Lisa?...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fine, me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm saying goodbye to everything I ever loved. Ooh, a marshmallow!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, when God closes a door, he opens a window.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I say when we're full. You don't wanna piss off a man who can kick you in the crotch from the inside.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I need a mouth hole. And some other holes too.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'VE GOT YOU DEEP IN THE HEART OF ME...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, Black Dracula is now a Congressman from Virginia.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I don't want to buy this house. I'd have to live next door to myself.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Turn that down!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh c'mon, Marge. It's not fair to compare us to an American household.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A slightly colder fridge? In my lifetime? Amazing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And check this out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A walk-in microwave! Hey Marge, can you press stop when my popcorn's done?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I kept that vow.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll build you a new kitchen, sweetie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A contractor? Those guys are the biggest crooks around. They charge for materials and labor! Pick one, jerks!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man, that hurt. And now to do the exact same thing again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Easy... easy...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Trying to.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I need them for the articles!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Of course not. Why would I want to look at a nude woman I'm not even married to? I mean, I wouldn't even know how she could improve me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Steady, steady...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, Marge. I can't wait to read about ""Sport Fishing With Sonny Jurgensen.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What man would want you now?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There it is, nice and smooth. I'd like to see your boyfriend the contractor do a better job.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, now you tell me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So that's what that white noise was.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Get lost, crook!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why don't you just kiss her?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How 'bout cooking up some money because this stupid kitchen cost a hundred thousand dollars.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I was thinking of chicken wings.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Those are good too.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Your mother's about to show us her new recipe.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I don't want to freak you out, but I think I love you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm proud of you, honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Adult themes? What are you talking about?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid Bart. Bagpipes getting down with an octopus... that's classic.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey sweetie, is Mom winning?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But she'll still win the contest?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But win the contest?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Woo-hoo! If Marge becomes Auntie Ovenfresh, we'll meet all the food personalities...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look! It's Mister Cashew... the Koobler Dwarfs... Snip, Crinkle and Poof...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Twinkle the Kidd, I love you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Blood for creme! Blood for creme!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Would you excuse us, Milton?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, and your father's ""No House."" Now scram.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Maybe I was a little hard on him. Oh, well. Bart, I know a father has no right to pry into the life of his ten-year-old son. But what's going on up here?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh-um... What do you think ""some"" is?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I thought I'd never have to do this, but it's time to tell you the facts of life.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do you know what a boob is?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Good. That'll save us some time. Okay... why do you think your mother and I sleep in the same bed?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Exactly. And we're poor because we have kids. And the biological method by which children are created by a man and a woman is...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, it's better they hear it from me now, than from their parents when they're old enough.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And Marge, you'll always be the best chef in our house.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, it keeps the kids quiet.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's ridiculous, honey. You're the cutest little girl I know. You just have what is known as the Simpson butt. Permit me to elaborate.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Every Simpson starts with a circle. Daddy has one big circle here... then a smaller one up here... two big, sexy circles for eyes... one macho muzzle... and a snappy new outfit. Hm, I'm lookin' good... ooh, cuffs... yeah... and for some reason, my hair and ear form an ""M"" and a ""G.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You wanna know a little trick? To downsize my derriÃ¨re, I just tie a sweater around it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,See?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Homer, you're wasting away to nothing. You simply must eat something. Well, you're the boss!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I love to see my man eat.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nice try, loser. I bet you made up a fake test.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah-ha! Here's a mistake. It says the capital of Kentucky is Frankfort. Dream on, pal.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really? Frankfurter... is that anything?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, boy, which con did you work here? Copy off another kid? Pay attention and take notes? Well, take note of this!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I thought you two broke up.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, what's the big deal? Bart didn't like his presents. So what? It's not like he gives us such great gifts. Remember that maple leaf ironed between the sheets of wax paper? What was that? That was crap.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So they're growing up. Soon they'll be leaving the nest, and you'll have time for yourself. Hundreds of thousands of hours. And then, the peace of the grave.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Open.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, that explains a lot. Who's hungry?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They're a family again. And so are we. What happened?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And Lisa, what have you learned?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But talking about the problem is the first step towards the solution, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, say something conclusive.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Open-ended! C'mon, Lisa. Say everything's fine. Everything's fine.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Prove it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Free cheese!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What's happened to us, Marge? We used to feed each other cheese and laugh all night. Then came the heart attacks.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! The circus!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! I don't know the difference!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What about that two-headed goat?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, but he came here to die.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"One of you ate tin cans, one of you ate health food. How you solved crimes I'll never know.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge! I figured out a way we can get in on this Quimby lawsuit! Bart, go ahead.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh? Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I sawed you on the television.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I believe it was the school's tuba.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Chloe, these kebabs you made are as good or better than anything I've ever had at this table.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Marge, I'm just being polite.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,More!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh come on, Marge. The only reason we don't move out of this dunghill is because of my court-ordered ankle bracelet.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm here! I'm here! Quit buggin' me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's a conversation starter!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I swallowed a chicken bone.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Same one.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good news, Marge!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've learned to walk naked on stilts!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Honey, her life can't compare to yours. You've got three kids, a TV tray from Expo sixty-seven, and you're married to King Stink!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, listen to me. Chloe may have a flashy job, but you're the backbone of this family. You're like the electrical tape that holds the two halves of my car together.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I just hate to see you upset, honey. You know what would be a good name for Maggie? Chloe.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ladies! There's no need to fight over me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh. Well then, carry on.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right. But while I'm gone, boy, you think about what you did.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You uh...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why you little... need a reason for strangling, do ya... I'll fix your wagon!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I'm growing ashamed of my penis.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, that's crazy talk. Now look, I'll save Lisa. Your place is here with the women.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, you go save Lisa. I'll stay here with the women.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What do women want?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay. I'll run as fast as I can, but I'm full of potato salad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Chief, my daughter's up there. You're a father too.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pretend to care!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whew!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I wouldn't say that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yes you are. Why, in the right light, you're starting to get your own muzzle.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, that's how it starts.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart's shirt is a classic, Marge. Just like ""Keep On Truckin'"". As if I would ever want to stop truckin'.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I've been reading this magazine for years, but I never dreamed my son would be on the cover.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You broke in!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah. Nothing makes parents happier than when an eccentric single man takes an interest in their child.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look at all that cash.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know what, Mr. Burns? I'm never comin' back. My son's making so much cash in the T-shirt game, that I don't have to work another day in my life -- assuming my health does not deteriorate as I age.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, can I ask you an important question?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Twenty-nine ninety-nine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lenny, Carl! How ya doin'?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's awesome. You know what I've gotten into? Sleeping 'til noon.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, just 'cause I'm not working doesn't mean I can't gripe like you guys. Don't you hate it when people steal your lunch out of the break-room fridge?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I see what's goin' on. You can't stand to be around a guy who's got total financial independence.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No problem. Bart, I need two hundred dollars.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I broke some bathroom fixtures.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm pathetic? Because I take money from my ten-year-old son? Well, let me tell you something: I still call the shots around here!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't have an inside voice!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The couch is like that tree!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, basic cable said I should nurture you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay! You be the girl, and I'll be the car.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Screw the market, we're going to Mexico!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's El Flanderito! Run him down!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's that dealy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you'll win for sure. You and science go together like Lenny and Carl. The science is Carl.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Honey, all you need's a little help from your dad. Remember, I did used to work at a science factory.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sweetie, that's orphan talk.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid atomic pile. How hard could it be to build a reactor? Korea did it. And look at the quality of their animation.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, maybe the internet has the information I need! It certainly answered a lot of my questions about wang enhancement.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,www.nuclear-secrets.com.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Are you a terrorist? No. ""Would you like to meet someone special but are tired of the bar scene?"" No. I will never tire of the bar scene!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Let's see, I can make that... you can get that by smashing open a golf ball... that you can find in any player piano...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,All I need is some plutonium and I know just the place to get it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Up-bup-bup-bup-bup, don't look!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sweetie, your Daddy's gonna show you just how much he loves you. You know that non-functioning nuclear reactor you built?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I juiced it up a little.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that's madiculous.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I never complain about your frilly pillows.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What's the matter, boy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, when you grew up, I grew down. But now I can see you need your Dad more than ever.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Get back in the garage, old man.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stay out of my boxes!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You give my son what he deserves, or I'll knock you on your delightfully offbeat ass!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sir, this is a class two plutonium fission reactor. If I turn this dial...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The resulting blast would destroy the entire tri-city area, including that guy who sells those Blu-Blocker sunglasses people sometimes wear.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Damn him to hell.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you prepared to take that chance?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not so fast. I also want some dribble glasses, fake boobs, two of Bart's T-shirts, and that rapping toilet seat.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yo, yo, yo! Keep it on the low flow!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm hangin' this over the mantel.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm just glad we're back to me being the father and you being the son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I doubt it. But we'll let the seagulls at the dump figure it out.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Par-ty! Par-ty! Par-ty!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Re-straint! Re-straint! Re-straint!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lighten up, Marge. This is my chance to relax with people from work I never get to see. Like this guy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really? How'm I doin'?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nice tux, Moe.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, it's a guy in a goofy Burns head!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Act like Burns!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's him to a T!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, a wooden plane. It's about time trees were good for something, instead of just standing there like jerks.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What a magical party this has been. Mr. Burns is a great man.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, Marge. This place is great. Free admission, great grub and we got to use the bathroom of the future.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Spill it, Super-boss!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll get a second job. One that pays well. You think those guys on ""Friends"" need another friend?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dammit! I would've been perfect as Rachel's Irish cousin. So you're all doing each other, are ya? Well, who's going to put out for old Seamus?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I need a new job that provides full health benefits.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"-- as long as I only work five hours a day, no heavy lifting, no light clerical, none of that secret Santa crap, tasteful nudity...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Phobos? That's a good job for me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I declare that you have the most beautiful brown eyes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dad?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The border, eh? Then I'd better sand off my fingerprints.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I could just wear gloves. Nah, they're upstairs.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hola, SeÃ±or. We are gringos who wish to spend mucho dinero in your country.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Drugs! Various drugs! Be sure to read instructions! Uh-oh! Where'd I put the instructions?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge? Bart? Lisa?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, this is just like Hawaii, but you don't get beaten up if you leave the hotel. What gives?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh man, I need something to settle my stomach.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh wait. I was supposed to take these with food.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why the sweet talk, Apu? Are you after some cheap drugs?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Flanders? I don't know... I mean, you haven't done anything for me since you lent me that five thousand bucks yesterday.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hold on. We're just innocent tourists.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No cameras?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen you two, I'll tell you who the true God is if you're both quiet the rest of the trip!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, I'm comin' back there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My butt looks so huge during perp walks.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dad, you tried your best. For the first time in my life I can say, without being drunk, that I truly admire you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,There are other ways to get into Canada...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's it, a plane!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sure it will. All we need is a pilot!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Katharine Hepburn?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We really appreciate your help, Johnny. Is there any way we can repay ya?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really? In America we do it four times a week. You come on down and I'll get us front row seats.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't dump me out! I can lose weight! Just give me a chance.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"One... two... Eh, I'd rather die.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, at least we're all in this together.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We'll make it, Dad. On a wing and a prayer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dammit.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Great news, honey! Burns made me a freelance consultant!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's this lump?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"See you in Hell, document!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now remember to eat smart, people. Go for the fancy foods -- don't let 'em fill you up with THAT cheap stuff.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Screw you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Smoked salmon... Shrimp... Crab legs!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I win...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I've never been so embarrassed. And the worst part is, this is brunch so you've ruined two meals! I'll see you all at lupper!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why did I ever have kids? I could have written symphonies, or been Shakespeare.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, who are you, the health inspector?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe's, a tribute. ""M"" is for Moe, the owner of Moe's. ""O"" is for the ""O"" in the middle of Moe's. ""E"" is for acceptance. The feeling I always got here at Moe's. Oh Moe, don't let 'em close you down!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I can't go to a gay bar, I'm too fat! Moe, I'm gonna help you reopen your bar no matter what it takes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,... Marge?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Put up my house? But I just paid it off... what would Marge say?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay honey, I'll do it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That was me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge! How dare you open a letter addressed to both of us?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I had to! Or Moe's would stay closed forever!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, look. I can see you're upset. If you need me, I'll be at Moe's.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you can't go with me to Moe's. I mean, how would you like it if I came with you to your mother's?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's because I hate her.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just made it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, I can't wait to get my lips around an ice cold...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But I don't wanna take care of the kids... Um... how many cigars are they allowed to have? Bart sleeps in the microwave, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"How many magic beans should I sell the baby for? Three? Duh, der, duh. That's me, jerk-ass Homer. Duh, der, doy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just what are you inferring?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whew, that's a relief!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah yes, Detroit-style. Very nice. So, you've been at Moe's every night this week.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bonded?! How many times?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, honey. My mind is completely at ease.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I might as well use this pucker for something.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Marge, don't you love it when our hands meet in the popcorn tub?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey Moe... haven't seen you in a while.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How do you know about that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You do?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well... I'm worried about Marge and Moe. They've developed an intimate bond of thoughts and feelings completely separate from me. But it's not physical. So everything's great, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can I learn it at a happy place?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What do I do?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're absolutely right! Stop this ride!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, my darling! Thank God you're home! I've been dying to hear your feelings!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I can go all night, baby. I could listen to you two, maybe three, times.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Catch your flight?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's a cuckold?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He's only your emotional uncle! I'm your real uncle!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm off!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hang on, Marge, Homie's comin'! I won't let that man make you happy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I have to get to the airport to save my marriage!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You gotta get me closer, Chief!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Toilet hole.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You leave my wife alone!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... ice?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it's true. I don't know Marge at all. I'll just go home now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe, you've won. I'll see you at baggage claim.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I just wanna say: if you ever feel like cheating on Moe, here's my card.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And you're my Margie-wargie-bargie-fargie-gargie-margie-targie-glargie.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen, I gotta tell ya, I chew in my sleep.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,THINK OF ME BABE WHENEVER / SOME SWEET TALKING GUY IN A THONG / HANDS YOU A BONG / DON'T TAKE...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,YOU BETTER BE STRONG,,,,,
Homer Simpson,'CAUSE I WANT A SANDWICH,,,,,
Homer Simpson,OR MAYBE A MANWICH...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, the prid is gone.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I've only got a hundred dollars. I'd better bid shrewdly.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,One hundred dollars!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dammit! I never win anything! Ooh, here's something I'm good at.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Easy... gentle...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm number one! I beat my son! Victory is mine, so kiss my behind!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boon chacalacala / / In your face! / My son flips frogs like a girl, yeah! A-boom! A-ba! A who's your daddy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sure do.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm happy!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid internet... whole world laughing at me...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The internet wasn't created for mockery. It was supposed to help researchers at different universities share data sets. It was!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I know why you're here. You wanna see me humiliate myself with my stupid dance. Well fine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! But why?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You wanna do my dance after you score?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo-hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""L"" is for ""loser,"" which describes you, sir. Don't try to stop me. Just enjoy the view, sir.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Honey, I bet you're wondering why Daddy's not at work again. The answer may surprise you. I have a new job choreographing end zone dances for a professional football player.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't forget showboating. That's the cornerstone of my ""Pyramid of Success.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, I forgot crotch grabbing. That'll be the sun.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"After you prance across the goal line, you hurl the other team's mascot to the ground, and drive your cleats into his neck!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're goin' down, you potato-eatin' pansy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Y'ello.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think I can fit you in. Let's see...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lenny, can I move you from Wednesday at noon to Sunday at six?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, all right, I'll work it out.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Welcome to the ""Homer Simpson Showboating Academy.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Today we're working on poor sportsmanship.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"First, I want you to hurl a ball at the nearest authority figure.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nicely done.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This is either about me, or steroids.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm the worst thing to happen to sports since Fox.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I wanna see him too. Maybe he can tell me how to get this off.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It soaked through to the other side!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow. At last, my pathetic little life has a meaning. You suckers, I would have done it for free!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dammit! Well, I'll still do it. You suckers, I would have paid you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dammit! Will you take a check?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dammit!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Every single Super Bowl halftime show has been great.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know. It's a lot of pressure. Do many people watch the Super Bowl?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh... uh... Oh man, I have no idea what I'm going.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I wonder if other Super Bowl producers waited until three in the morning the night before to plan their halftime shows.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A church! Maybe the homeless people sleeping on the floor will have some ideas.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Flanders. Eh, I guess you've got some late night problems too.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Have you tried checking the oil filter?,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"But then a shadow of wickedness fell across the land, as represented by this cloud of white pesticide!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But there was one righteous man: Noah!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh mighty God, send a flood to destroy this wickedness.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"After forty days and forty nights, the rains stopped, and Noah sent forth a single dove...",,,,,

Homer Simpson,Oh son!... Taking your tombstone back to the store will be the happiest thing I've ever done.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...Bart was never kidnapped! Lisa, I'm very glad you brought me this. I'll see that it gets to the proper authorities.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hollywood producers have paid me a fortune, which I've already lost, for the rights to Bart's story. So I have to destroy anything that proves that story's not true.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What shirt? I don't see any shirt.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Burn the truth. Burn the truth.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"But I'm only two hundred dollars short of fourteen thousand, eight hundred dollars.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Opposite? Yuck!!,,,,,

Homer Simpson,Do you Cletus take Brandine to be...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute! Are you two brother and sister?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Please, Kent. Call me Your Holiness.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Kent, not anything. It has to exist. Or does it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If you love the Bible so much, why don't you marry it? In fact, I now pronounce you and the Bible man and wife. And you're the wife. You owe me two hundred bucks.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Which will lead to a lot more impulsive marriages. Which will put more green in the blue. The blue being my pants.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lemme get my belt sander. Maybe I can grind the ugly off your face.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I wasn't joking.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, big surprise. Hey Marge, here's another bomb: I like beer.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now Patty, here's a veil I picked out just for you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Give it back!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, that's the stupidest idea I ever heard. And I know exactly who would pay top dollar for it.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Queerly beloved, we're here to join Veronica and Patty in matrimony. But the news isn't all good. They've written their own vows. Patty?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Next!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If anyone knows a reason why these two should not be joined, let them speak now... or forever hold their peace.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"People please, can we wrap this up? It's gonna rain and I've gotta get the bikes in here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Patty, I admire your decision. It takes courage to follow your heart and walk out on a non-refundable wedding ceremony. So I'm gonna waive the rose petal removal fee and prorate the cake-handling surcharge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I just love it here. So many things, and so many things of each thing!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Dad. How I'll miss your cap, your walking stick, your plaster base...",,,,,

Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! No pressure!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, dammit! Chief, how are we supposed to live with our kids constantly separated?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, son -- no one's gonna make you count to twenty. I have a more humane solution.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This twenty-foot pole will make Bart's restraining order oh-so-easy to enforce. And I used my Sprawl*Mart employee discount to buy this fancy pole cover. It'll keep your pole looking great, poke after poke after poke!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Show you what it's like in the real world!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, he's all ""Cowabunga, dude!"" What's that mean? Nothing, I bet.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! That's been my dream ever since I heard it existed right now. What do I get?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I won't do it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I'm a U.S. citizen.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dios mio!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, boy. This is the only place that's two hundred feet from Lisa but still on our property.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, why'd you lock the door? We're still inside!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I've never worked all night, never! And I worked at an all-night diner for three years! I slept on the grill.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You monster!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's it, mister. I am disgruntled. And up until now, I was relatively gruntled!",,,,,

Homer Simpson,I'll be back for tall kitchen bags!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mmm, hot dog.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I just don't understand what the problem is.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, menopause is when the stork that brings babies gets shot by drunken hunters.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And it's something to be feared -- right, Doctor?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on kids, we should go. Goodbye, Selma.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I know. That was for the other patients.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My thingies!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Great, another job lost to a foreigner.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I just felt a chill go through my very soul.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"How about that Selma, flying all of us to China for no apparent reason?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And how 'bout me getting off work by saying I'm teaching math skills to inner city youths. Yes, there are many kinds of heroes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey look, a dragon.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll give you one.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey dragon! You fly like a girl!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You name it, oh wise mountain ape.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nooooooo!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, I don't want her to be happy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Deal.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, I'll do it. Because your sweet love is the one thing that saved my life from being an unmitigated disaster. Ha-ha, now we're even!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, it makes the Lincoln Memorial look like crap.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And this is Marge, our surprisingly hot nanny.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't mention it, Miss October. But don't look at her passport, it's different.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wha?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I hope you washed your hands first.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,I finally get this play!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm a nuclear--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm a Chinese acrobat!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You guys are commies? Then why am I seeing rudimentary free markets?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nice chair toss. Good one, skinny. / You guys get these chairs from Regal Rents? / Boy, you're a great stacker. / Hi, Lisa. / Now that's precarious.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, this is easy. Maybe I am the world's greatest acrobat.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, you're curing me with acupuncture.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Awww. She likes my eyes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I would, but Marge would kill me... I mean ohh, right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It wasn't easy, Marge -- I've missed you so much.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is there any other kind?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, the fortune cookies here really are more accurate.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I am so sorry about what happened. But at least you saw what it was like to be married to me for a little while.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who told you that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now let's see... which one is Ling?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ling?... Ling?... Ling?...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ling!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I was this woman's husband for a few days, in name only, and beer will soon obliterate that memory. But I don't think this baby could find any greater love on your planet or ours.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But he loves me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little... I'll endanger you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Something's wrong with Bart. He's acting weird.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait, you're not Bart! Eh, close enough.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmmm. Seems a shame to chuck out these cross-country skis. I'll keep one.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Let's see now... ""Kill spiders?"" We don't have spiders.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid spider... afraid of dying.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Aha! Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Spider poison is people poison?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Baaart!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hm, where's the pain? There it is!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A spider!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry. If I croak, you'll marry Lenny. Or Moe -- the winner will be determined by a card game I invented. I got all the rules written down... up here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sure, if it'll give you peace of mind. But I'm not gonna die for many, many years.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Haven't we all?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"None. No wait, three. Since the last one, I don't remember so good.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes I am.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sssh! I want her to think I'm cool!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If I sign it, it still counts!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My hemophilia!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uninsurable?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Way ahead of you, Marge -- I just ordered a series of tapes on saving money. They should get here soon. I paid a bundle for over-night delivery.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay. I'll just hire a haulage firm to cart them away... at my expense!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Directory assistance?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'll get a lawyer on that. No, a whole team of lawyers. Who will dine on mustard flown in from the Orient.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm sorry, Moe. Marge won't let me spend any money -- even counterfeit money!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's my money... I'm the one who earns it... drinking beer out of a thermos like an animal...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, your penny-pinching rampage has gone too far.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You can't enjoy money when you're dead, so why not have fun now?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I earn that money -- while you lounge around here, doing laundry and putting up drywall, I'm at work busting my hump.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, President Franklin.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I invented a Popsicle made of Mountain Dew.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You banged?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I spent our savings on the down payment for a motor home. I need a castle where I can be king!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dammit!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kids, your mother and I have decided to take a little break from each other. While we deal with our issues, I plan to go on ""Motorhome Makeover"" and trick this thing out like a palace, not like that dump you live in. All I need is for someone to start a show called ""Motorhome Makeover.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I couldn't leave you kids. You're like my own family. Now check this place out!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've got Gameboys and caramel apples!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll let you punch me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We'll have Christmas tomorrow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Free gas!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, I wouldn't mind driving that to the Holland, Michigan Tulip Festival.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmmm. A place to dock, eh? I got room -- I have a back yard that makes my front yard look like an idiot.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you crazy? Let twelve complete strangers live on my lawn?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's a deal! Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Welcome, welcome. If my wife asks, you're here for a Boz Skaggs concert.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,These are my new friends. They like me for me... and my plumbing and gas hookups.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's a lot of places.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Marge. We've got the power now. And you can't turn us off!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's no marriage bed -- it's a loveless slab of bossiness!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Name one way I'm not!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I seem to recall you asked me to get this fat!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm Marge Simpson. Don't eat off the floor.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That was my Woodstock!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah, Marge? What about my womanly needs?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, that judge thought I rocked. Case closed! Although my case is still open.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If you need me, I'll be in my trailer!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"My RV is gone! It was more than a motor home. It was a car I could go to the bathroom in. Hey, a note.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, this is a parent's worst nightmare! They've stolen a car and they're home alone.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't worry about the SUVs. There's a gentle curve up ahead.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart! Pull over!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm not a machine -- I can't just turn it on!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thank God for that Turkish freighter. Now we'll just go get 'em and...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bring back our children, you Cyprus-splitting jerks!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Will you raise them Christian?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Noooo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, Marge -- once again, your Mom-ly wisdom averted disaster.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I promise I will return this RV first thing in the morning. Easy... easy... easy... easy...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you're taking this pretty well.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cool.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, we'll compromise. We'll go see a play...that Lisa doesn't want to see.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hoot! Hoot! Hoot! Hoot! Hoot!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey cat, get your own pants!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Kids! Why's the cat so fat?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Make it seven!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,There must have been a mistake. My body is a temple.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But he misread my pee! He misread my peeeee!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stupid prison guard job thinks its so big. Everyone gets a prison job but me. All my best friends are guards. They think they're so cruel and corrupt, but they're not.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sometimes I go to the movies alone.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm not supposed to be new meat. I'm supposed to have your job.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my God! That man might be hurt! Guards, there's a prisoner in there!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Squealin'? No, I just wanted to help him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Really? You mean eat cheese, gnaw through electrical cords, things like that?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Burns, I've thought about it, and I don't wanna be a snitch. It's not an honorable life.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I am a sucker for a little hat.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well... I don't know.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I would like to survive long enough to see the effects of global warming. I've got an inside tip that it's all a bunch of crap. Okay, you've found your snitch.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Homer Simpson has become a snitch.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Say, is that a gang tattoo? I thought those weren't allowed.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's right, an unauthorized tattoo. I came here right away.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Who? Oh, that ""my mother."" Tell him thanks.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, if you really must know...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm a prison snitch.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sure, they're on top of the world. Then there's a big riot scene. Then I don't know, I usually doze off.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What are you dopes lookin' at? You've never seen bling-bling before?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How come nobody told me before?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,There's gonna be a breakout tonight.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Deal!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What happened to the guards?! Okay, okay. Don't panic. Maybe they'll tire themselves out with their chant.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, they're gonna kill me! I only did what I had to do to survive... in a style befitting a French monarch.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fly, Segway! Fly!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge! How did you get in here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, c'mon!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We'll be safe in the gas chamber.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm sorry I got you into this mess. Can I snitch on my heart and say... ""I love you""?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hold on a minute. Governor, I've been using my powers of snitching for evil. But now I want to tattle for good. This prison is a hellhole. They feed us horse meat -- with traces of jockey meat!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The guards are sadistic and cruel!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You know what I missed in the joint? Just lying here watching you sleeping sweetly... sleeping sweetly...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,...sleeping sweetly...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I won't tell if you don't tell.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen to me! This whole building is unsafe. They cut corners everywhere. People, it's a death trap!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How do you know the title of my prophetic vision?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What'd I miss? What'd I miss?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, maybe I was partying so hard with my single friends last night, I forgot the rules.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why? Is it messing you up?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stupid wildlife, serves 'em right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, right. Separated.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, sometimes people just grow apart, like me and your Mom.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"She'll realize she was a fool, when...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey! Come back with my patio furniture!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stupid flounders. Hey, I've got a great idea. We'll find some new lady friends.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, boy, we're hitting the town. After decompressing, of course.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,There's a DVD player but it doesn't work.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I know! It's a hover car!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You wish, loser!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Moe, hey Moe-clone.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, I think I see my two favorite letters of the alphabet. E-Z.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, say hello to Edna.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oopsie.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Marge, why are you with Krusty? These kids are too old for clowns.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, man, she's not my lady anymore. We split up, it's all cool, I... I'll kill you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Much better.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I thought you'd never take me back after what I did to Krusty.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Exactly.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You don't know the half of it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, Marge -- Hot Wheels to the rescue!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The water flows down here, through the straightaway, a couple of wicked S-turns...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Around the loop of death...And out the mail slot! Then it's the yard's problem.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, that's it. I'm going to Moe's!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's raining outside.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lousy cat.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid Homer-hating family. At least there's one place I'm always welcome.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, guys. This is just what I needed.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So what's Stephen Hawking doing here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So why didn't you invite me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I wouldn't ruin a surprise for Lenny.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm sorry. I'll just sit over here until you stop being mad at me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, watch what you say about him. I think Ray could be the one.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I can see I'm not wanted here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My family hates me... my stupid friends kick me out of their stupid party! They'll all be sorry when I invent the world's best-tasting cola... and share it with no one!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A sign!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Finally, a bar for men who like to drink and look at sexy women.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'd like a beer and a sympathetic ear.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How did it ever come to this? I'm the first man ever to feel depressed in a bar. I don't have a friend in the world.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The sun.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, it's been so long since I've been with someone who doesn't know what a selfish pig I am.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mine. Oh, move your hand. I get this!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ray, you know me better than anyone. How can I get my wife to love me again?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ray, will you help me fix my roof?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait, did I add that right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,To my new buddy. Now all we need is an awesome theme song. Whatever plays next on the jukebox.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Next song. / That's what I meant. / Absolutely.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think that means six more weeks of Autumn.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, honey. I found us a roofer last night, and you'll never guess where.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How did you know?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're right, Marge -- I guess I should look for roofers at poetry slams and yoga retreats.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,High-five!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ray would high-five me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh Ray! You came at the agreed-upon time.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Impresses. What a big word! I'm gonna look that up.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I didn't really check. I mainly bought this house for the view.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Some day that bowl will overflow, and I'll be there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry about that, pal.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"One, two, three, four -- I declare a nail war!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ned, are you okay?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's Ned Flanders. There's one in every neighborhood.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Goodbye, Ray! Bye! Oh, he turned the corner. Ooh! Now I see him again!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't worry -- Ray'll be back any minute.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"My new best friend. We think alike, we act alike, we finish each other's sandwiches...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ray's not gonna like that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well if I was, we'd have taller kids!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know son, my dad used to take me down to Johnson's Hardware. Old man Johnson knew everything about fixin' stuff. When they built this place, he hung himself.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh sorry, son. I wanted you to bring me the stack of tiles from the top shelf. Hey, Ray's here!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's in the box?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Of course we are! If you wanna be.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't have to -- Ray's gonna be here any minute.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, then you can just look at the portrait I painted of him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Something like that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Did you make enough for Ray?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He is too! His truck's gonna come around the corner riiight now. Right now. Right now. Now. Now. Nnnnnnnnow. Now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now. Now. Nnnow.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh thank God. Where is he? Tell me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ray wouldn't fit in my head -- he's a human man.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes he does. He's on his way and when he gets here, we'll have ever so much fun! You'll see!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, how we'll laugh!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's going on? Where are my shoes?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What am I doing here? Let me go!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fine, I admit it. Help me, Ray! Appear and strike them down!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But that's not true, Bart saw him at the Builder's Barn.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Flanders, you saw Ray on the roof with me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ned, are you okay?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,There has to be someone who saw him -- someone who doesn't hate me like Flanders and Bart... Wait! The bartender at Knockers.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow. My subconscious is a genius. Well, that's all very convincing, and...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, that's a world of difference. Light me up, doc!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, what did he die of?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry. Give me one that doesn't taste so good.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, write that down so we can have it at home.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,

Homer Simpson,The awesome power of the human mind.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, Ray does exist?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute. I went through a lot of pain and suffering because of this little misunderstanding. Somebody owes me big!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's a given! There's something else. Something much more else.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not if those gutters aren't clean, you don't.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What are you talking about?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What time's the show on?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And what's the network?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,At what time?,,,,,

Homer Simpson,So if I turn my radio on at nine o'clock...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So it's Mondays at nine, on NBC.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,CBS.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,On the radio.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Television at three o'clock.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, no machine could ever replace you. Why you-- or could it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge-bot! I'm ready for some lovin'!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why did I give her a gun? But I repeat: no one is being replaced by a machine. Until all the kinks are worked out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, my little boy's in love.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, son. You can fight this. Do the Bartman. Do the Bartman!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why don't you dance? Dance?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Doctor, little kids aren't supposed to have heart attacks. They're supposed to skin their knees, and poke their eyes out, and be smothered by cats.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You get better, son. Meanwhile, the rest of us will be going to the ""library.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Milkshake Festival. Look, you can see the booths from your window.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, take a picture of me with all the milkshakes. C'mon, everybody get in here. Hurry.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Overeating. And if there's time, we'll get to my drinking. But there won't be time.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, he's just the kind of weirdo Bart needs.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, I just wanna leave you with a piece of advice -- become emotionally dead. Leave your body. Make lots of friends!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That freeloading fatso! Marge, could you cut back on your makeup budget?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So that's where my soot went!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Even better, I'll ask him for my job back.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Youth? I hate them. Secondly...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"How much is got, Wolfgang Schmuck?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fifty dollars? What about all the water you guys will waste with your bathing and showering and washing your clothes?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"GÃ¼ten abend, my brave, Bavarian Overlords. The best wurst in town.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,NEUNUNDNEUNZIG LUFTBALLONS / AUF IHREM WEG ZUM HORIZONT / HIELT MAN FUER UFOS AUS DEM ALL / DARUM SCHICKTE EIN GENERAL /,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"EINE FLIEGERSTAFFEL HINTERHER / ALARM ZU GEBEN, WENN ES SO WAR / DABEI WAR DA AM HORIZONT / NUR NEUNUNDNEUNZIG LUFTBALLONS",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Did you hear that Foxy, the Fox network Fox?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh boy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I know this is ill-gotten, but can we use it to...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Time to take out the Euro-trash.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, everything's perfect again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But who else needs to lose weight? Maggie? Grampa? My seldom-seen half brother Herb?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why is everyone looking at me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I am not too fat. I'm alive, aren't I?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that's terrible.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where will I sleep?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cheeseburger.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't wanna.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Here's a corner.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're a selfish jerk.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But it's my burger.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine. I'd rather die.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I need change for a dollar.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's the cheapest thing you've got?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Five ninety-nine?! What a rip-off! Someone should shoot you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Interesting. It's like a corndog without the dog.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't miss meat at all. This Portobello mushroom eats like a steak. A rubbery, fungus-like steak.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm giving birth to a food baby.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think it's staying down. It's staying down! It's not staying down.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait. Yes, it's staying down. Oh no, it's not! Yes it is. No it's not! Yep. No. Yep. No! Yep. No! Yep. No. Yep. No. Yep. no.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where's my bucket?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lisa sings so sweetly and Bart is my pillow... everyone's good for something.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And she's giving us the emotional experience of a lifetime. Oh, thank you for this angel, Lord!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't lose hope, sweetie. I'm gonna write you a song so great, you can't lose. And that's not just the beer talking. Your father's in here too.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here you go, honey. Sing this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Much of the tune is plagiarized. Now go, go, go!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You did it, sweetie!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Of course, Sweetie. You and I are gonna write and sing our way out of this godforsaken Hellhole.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I wrote it about Shelbyville, then changed the names.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good job, sweetie. Every time you hit that note, I'll shoot a glass with my BB gun.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Honey, our time together is precious to me. I didn't want to say anything, but I don't think I'm gonna be around much longer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, Moe's getting a big screen TV in February. Just in time for the Pro Bowl. Maybe this time my beloved blue shirts will win.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let Daddy go talk to the man.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,May I have a word with you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Is that green enough for you, sweetie? 'Cause I can make it greener...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry honey, the song I wrote you is so schmaltzy, it'll make ""Moon River"" sound like a farting Orangutan.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, Lisa and I were just discussing how to improve tonight's performance. Now you're confusing her by telling her she was perfect.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My little girl likes Red Vines! You little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You think I can't kill you? There's a hundred little punks graduating from Syracuse this year that would beg to kiss my ass! Get outta here!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, these are Red Vines. Here you go, sweetie. Daddy got you your candy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, gimme a break. Living through Lisa is the healthiest thing that ever happened to me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You love sausage but you hate to see it getting made.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then would you like to see it getting made?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fired... me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Everything I did, I did for you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do you know the hours I worked? The people I had to yell at? The tires I had to slash?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's called smoozing!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, come back! I'm calming down! We'll have family fun! Family funnnnn!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, everybody...I brought a guest.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Someone who appreciates my in-your-face management style.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ha! Smart move. Soon the whole world will be lining up to suck my nose. After I make my new client a star.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"His name isn't Cameron anymore. He's now ""Johnny Rainbow.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm not Mr. Simpson. That ship has sailed. I'm Colonel Cool! And I'm the Captain on this rocket to the stars.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Neither. I'm both.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, I wanna teach you a little something about jazz hands.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't stop till it's as natural as breathing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge. Bart. Maggie. Santa's Little Helper. Lisa!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't think cookies are gonna make me feel better.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh God! Oh, they're delicious! Oh, so happy! Oh God, they're... They're gone.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We are!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Flanders?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay Morty, gimme a rose-colored spot, tight to the mid-chest and an aqua background with an astronaut on a surfboard.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lisa.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um, at the end of your song, remember to look into the spotlight. It makes your eyes twinkle.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're welcome.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I always was, honey. Look. Cameron's about to sing the song I wrote for him. He's about to learn the most important lesson in the music business: don't trust people in the music business.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sure did. I'd do anything for you, honey. Especially if it's easy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll always be there. Not even death will stop me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"How 'bout ""I love you, honey?""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kids, wanna go to the mall?! They're baking fresh Cinnabons... which means they're throwing out the old ones!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I love you, Dumpster-bons.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, big surprise. The fat guy's eating garbage.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Left Below."" Ooh, a ""He Is Risen"" production!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Finally, a character I can relate to. I bet good things happen to him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Left below?! Where have I heard that before?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's everywhere!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This movie will haunt me for the rest of my life, just like Cannonball Run Two.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge... what if the Rapture is coming and I haven't led a good enough life? I could be... left below!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, I'll bet the cats would be psyched about that. Thanks Marge, you've put my mind at ease. Now how about a little ""rapture"" for Mama?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, but it's tough for me not to think about their hardship.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge is right -- the Rapture isn't coming! There haven't been any ominous signs!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Blood is raining from the sky!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Judgment day is at hand.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Begat. Uh, do you have any books on the Rapture?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll take everything you've got!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, thank you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, the Rapture is nigh. These books will help me figure out how nigh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This whole deal is scientifically proven. The Book of Revelation has four hundred and four verses... add the number of people at The Last Supper...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,...minus the number of Filipinos in the Bible...And you get...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"He writes ""3150518"" on the board.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Up bup bup!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Three fifteen p.m., May 18th! That's when the Rapture will be!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A week? That's...seven days from now!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The world will end next week! Spend your children's college fund! Thaw that turkey now!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Funny story, Kent. It's the end of the world! God loves you! He's gonna kill you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here's my angle: there's no way in God's Heaven I should get into God's Heaven. But maybe he'll let me in, if I warn others the Apocalypse is coming, as I previously shouted.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uhhh...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here's one -- Revelation 6:13. Just before the Rapture, ""the stars will fall to the Earth."" So all you hippies out there might want to for that one.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, in a world gone mad, only a lunatic is truly insane.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well... I guess this thing does look pretty silly. Let's all take off our sandwich boards and watch TV.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"When the time comes, we won't be in our homes...because we're all gonna go here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Exactly. It came to me in a vision. Or maybe it was a drunken haze. Or, possibly, an ice cream headache.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, Flanders. It's... uh... a meeting of gay witches for abortion. You wouldn't be interested.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, everybody. Pair up with a Rapture buddy who will watch your back through all eternity.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But sweetheart, I have something they didn't have -- a good feeling about this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, Lisa. No one in this family is being left below.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, Dad! There's a bus coming for you! Drive, drive!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, guys. Get ready! We're just seconds away!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Goodbye, stupid Earth!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh. My watch must be running fast. Wait for it... wait for it... wait for it...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait for it... wait for it... wait for it...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait for it... wait for it...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Please don't go! Please? Please? I command you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, you still believe in me, don't you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, that's my girl.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Let's go to Moe's. We'll walk and punch.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe, what happened to your eponymous tavern?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you with the tempura -- your arm broken?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...Ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen?! Twelve apostles... but Jesus was at the last supper too! This changes everything.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Multiply by seven... don't forget to carry the six, six, six...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wake up! The Rapture is coming in half an hour! There's no time to waste! Marge, grill a chicken! No, make sandwiches! And some Kettle Chips would be nice! Original, not barbecue!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Forget school! We have to get to the mesa!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But my prediction says--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid family... won't even come to my Rapture... I went to Lisa's school play -- which had serious pacing problems.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Three... two... one...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'm wrong again. I'm nothing but a big, fat... oh!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! I was right!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And there's the Earth. So beautiful with your many rings.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm comfortable like this.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How come it's not open yet?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hm...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thanks. Listen... could you do me one more favor?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, sorry, uh -- I'd tip you, but I don't have any cash.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I could.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait! Before you go, there's one thing I gotta know. What happened to my family?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've gotta save them.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lord, you got a first-class destination resort here. Really top notch. But I can't enjoy myself knowing my family is suffering.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, he'll be fine. And you could still spare my family by--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Buddy, you just made yourself a powerful enemy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Screw you, Dino! You squandered your gift!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm sorry. But Heaven isn't Heaven without my family in it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just send me back to Earth, and put off this whole Rapture hoop-de-do for another couple of years or so.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Superman did it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I'm in a good place with that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, I'll definitely read those later.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now listen, if you could just see your way clear to...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It was all just a dream.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But what are these wings? Oh, it's just a seagull stuck in my back.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, I missed you guys too. Now if you'll excuse me...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thank you, Lord! It's back the way it was.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ah... this is heaven.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Prison overcrowding, I've got a solution for that. Oh my God! U-S-A! U-S-A!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Free movie tickets?! I feel like Roger Ebert, or his kiss-ass new partner!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,She'll be fine here under the watchful eye of Grandma Shark Week.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How about this guy?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Shut up, Flanders, I need a favor. Would you mind watching Maggie for a while? It would only be until later.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on Flanders, doesn't that ""Bible"" of yours say to ""love thy neighbor""? Why won't you love me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, Ned.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You wear a bathing suit in the bathtub?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Makes sense.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This theater sucks. My seat's uncomfortable, the screen's only half a screen, and that guy's eating an apple!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've had enough -- I'm leaving!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm stuck. Why did I eat that apple segment?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What are you kids laughing at? And if you say Jimmy Fallon, I'll know you're lying.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Scantily-clad co-eds?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little... I'll teach you to have a libido!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait'll I tell everyone about this! I'll feel important without drinking! That'll be weird.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What a combination -- hot chicks and stupid Flanders.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yep, and nobody's tellin' him. Not even his good buddy God.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sensual, isn't it? And the best part is Stupid Flanders doesn't even know it's happening in his stupid house. Hence my nickname, Stupid Flanders.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Moses, are you a loser?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes I am, Homer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, I need to pee, but I can't stop watching. Fetch me a bottle.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, we're watching the latest photos from Mars. Ho, great stuff. Worth every billion.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well that's obvious. He doesn't even know.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, I'm thinking about getting a yogurt franchise. It's called ""Plops"" and...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay. Flanders, you see...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ned, I had no choice. It was just so funny!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmm... soggy br--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,...ead.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're right. But you know who the real victim is here? Ned.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's this? Goodbye Springfield...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Last-diddily-ast? He's gone! And it's all someone's fault!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, Marge. I've taken every precaution.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hi, I'm Homer Simpson. I live next door. So, is that your whistle?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um, listen, uh, neighboreeno, I want to start our relationship off on the right foot, so if you need anything... anything at all...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, I'll straighten things out with Coach Clay. We're good buddies. We play this game called ""who can punch the softest?"" And he always lets me win!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Coach, do you mind turning down the music? My baby's trying to take a nap.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lookin' good... feel the burn...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're a god!... I can't think of any more!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Go! Go! Go!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you knocked out my power. How am I supposed to eat without watching TV?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,When are you gonna stop poking me? Will it be soon?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I siphoned that gas from Flanders! Flanders...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Like a woman who's made the biggest mistake of her life.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I was just driving around the mid-Atlantic states, ringin' doorbells at random, and I just... oh, who am I fooling with my awesome lies? I want you to come back to Springfield.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,After the party.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I wanna make you a respecting stock. I don't know if you've noticed, but I've borrowed a lot of your stuff over the years...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Shut up, Flanders. But some things I could never take from you: your kindness, your gentle spirit...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...and your infinite patience with a big, dumb jerk like me. Oh, Ned, I don't deserve you as a neighbor, but will you forgive a young, handsome fool and come home?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I am a little pudgy. You got me. Yeah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I saw my advantage and I took it. That's what heroes do.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, Ned. Get ready for your welcome home surprise.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maybe. We don't know that for sure.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Go nuts.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Flanders. Okay, that's it. Really irritating!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, I can't believe you got expelled. Well, don't expect to spend all week lying around on the couch like a bum 'cause that's my thing!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And if you get kicked out of that one, you're going straight in the Army. Where you'll be sent straight to America's latest military quagmire. Where will it be? North Korea? Iran? Anything's possible with Commander Cuckoo Bananas in charge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"How can we afford any of these private schools? They're all so expensive. If we want to throw good money after bad, why don't we just get Grampa that new pacemaker?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get 'em from the smoke detector.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The smoke will wake us up.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Catholic school, eh...?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That'll straighten you out, boy. There, you don't just get bad grades -- you go to Hell!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Classic Grampa.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I didn't need that new fact! Now I forgot who won Bud Bowl Eight. Boy, I'm pulling you outta that crazy school!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No meat?! What do they eat, light bulbs?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart! What the Hell are you saying?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mickey Mouse's dog?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey! I'm Bart Simpson's father, and I'm sick of you teaching my son your time-tested values! Hey, what's that smell?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You've transformed breakfast into dinner. It's a miracle!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Log Cabin full of taste, my stomach is with thee. Blessed art thou among syrups and...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All pancakes aside, I really came here to talk about my son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bingo? That's my favorite game. I just can't remember what to yell out when you win.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's my favorite game. I just can't remember what to yell out when you win.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bingo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You have to cheat.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, listen, is it true you priest guys can't ever... you know...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Celibacy?! I was talking about the meat on Friday thing. Man, you guys got more crazy rules than Blockbuster Video.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. No matter what I did, no matter how many people lost their pensions, it's forgiven like that?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, let's make some magic here. I wiped a booger on your shirt, I made a dog and a cat kiss, I swiped a bolted-down TV from a Holiday Inn...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...I coveted the wife in ""Jaws 2,"" I lied to a waiter, I masturbated eight million times and I have no plans to stop masturbating in the future.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Woo hoo! I'm clean! In your face, Lord!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Right. And how do I join? Do I whale on some Unitarians?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, Marge, I know I was supposed to yell at that Priest, but he's so cool. He plays drums in a band with a bunch of other priests!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, no one is saying twelve. Nine, ten, tops. See...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, relax. I've never heard of anyone getting so upset about religion.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow! Up here, that feels good!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Transubstantiation!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Welcome to the jungle, Kevin!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, what are you doing here?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you bring Bart home now! Once you go Vatican, you can't go back again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Face it, Marge -- Catholics rule. We've got Boston, South America, the good part of Ireland, and we're making serious inroads in Mozambique, baby!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why does that woman thwart my sporadic interest in my children? Shouldn't Bart and I be able to choose our own religion if we want to?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bwa?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hop in, boy! We'll show your mother our god kicks her god's butt.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,C'mon Broncos... you can do it...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The Broncos won?! Why didn't I bet on them, like Professor Pigskin told me to?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,He's a pig who can predict football winners... in advance!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Because he's got something no gambler's ever had: a system.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I've gotten the pamphlet four weeks in a row, and every time, the ""pick of the week"" has been right on the money.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I have money!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A scam? Not according to ""Eddie F. from Tucson,"" or ""Football Millionaire in Beloit, Michigan.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,...expiration date oh-six oh-eight.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Professor Pigskin told me to bet on the Raiders but they look awful.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I didn't bet any of our money. I just borrowed some from him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's not my fault the Raiders lost, it's Professor Pigskin's!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But the pig!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge would kill me! Please, there's gotta be something else I can do. Like mow your lawn every week for two weeks. I can't do it next week.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, you can shoot your gay adult film at my house.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They're shooting an adult film at my house tomorrow. How am I gonna get rid of Marge and the kids?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, Moe!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It got your hopes up, didn't it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I swear.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Because you look even more beautiful now than the day I married you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Guys, get out of here!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, if you promise never to tell her, I'll let you be in the movie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you guys almost done?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um... you're in the wrong house, lady.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Honey, please, just listen to what I have to say.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I owed the mafia money...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where are you going?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,When will you be back?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who's gonna watch the kids?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Me? But I'm the father.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Honey, come back! You didn't say bye to the kids!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, we'd better go eat that yogurt.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kids, I'm sure your mother will be back soon.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, we've been down this road before. I do something stupid, your Mom leaves, we eat waffles.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You mean ""Homer's famous marinara sauce.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where's your sense of magic and wonder?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, Marge. When are you gonna call?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let it ring. Play hard to get. That's hard enough!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh-my-darling-I-love-you-please- forgive-me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Moe! What are you calling me for?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, what if Marge tries to call while I'm talking to you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Of course I have call waiting, you idiot! I just never learned how to use it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh. That might have broken the phone. I'd better call Moe.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Moe! Will you get off the line!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge. What a pleasant surprise.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no. It's not gonna be like that, I swear.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ew, lemon cream! You're goin' in the Marge pile. I mean I love you so much...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hello? Marge? Where do we keep the socks that don't smell like feet?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, Marge?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Does the pizza guy take a check? If so, where do we keep the checks? And lastly, how do you write a check?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gotta find your Mom. Gotta find your Mom.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It was hard enough gettin' you in there. I'm not lettin' you out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Rugged? Is that the same as handsome?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, kids, we'll stop for the day. I have cousins near here. We'll stay with them.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, the rubiest. Ooh look! A new restaurant chain!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We'll say it's all our birthdays!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I warned you he was an idiot. Well, all I need is some moonshine and someone playin' the har-mon-a-key, and I'm as happy as a pig in plop!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't laugh! They're doing the best they can.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, just great. Things couldn't be better.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"She, uh, was killed by a falling air conditioner.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It wasn't all bad. As part of the settlement, her funeral was air conditioned.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now if you'll excuse me, I have to use the outhouse again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You lost that first game to hustle me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,These are for you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen, I thought about what I did. And it was really, really wrong. I'm sorry.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I love you, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wha...?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're needed at home!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're needed at home!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, that's very reasonable.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You stole my wife! I'll kill you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow. I can see why she loves you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You know everything.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And what a man!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, the key to this thing is the manatees. Is Marge saving them or killing them?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay. To save the manatees, I guess I could donate my time and money and help them build a... eh, screw that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why don't you pick on someone your own size?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, if it were up to me, I'd be harassing them with you. If anything, I'd be the guy who took it too far. But I love my wife and I want to win her back!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Rubes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Catch me if you can!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Manatees -- defend!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Poor dumb country mouse. Can't even count.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Rubes... so many rubes... pounding me with their jet skis... rubes! Please, no rubes...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm always amazed you chose me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, since we've got the kids with us, why don't we all take a few days of much-needed R and R?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes... but I've got a friend who owes me a solid.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Flanders, I can't listen to your crap before my coffee.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid best friend Flanders.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stamps? Those are for snail mail! Stamps rule! I mean suck!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I think they killed each other. You know, one of those murder-suicide deals.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What man would want this now?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Two four six eight! I hate stamps! They aren't great!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, how about this? Seven, four three one... oh wait, that's my pin number. Everyone forget that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look at the bright side, Marge. When I die, you can mourn me from the bathroom. That's multi-tasking.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, just let me clear some space.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I love waking up drunk in the morning.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I, uh, needed them for my remote control helicopter.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,There's a little plastic man in your hair and I'm trying to rescue him.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No soldier left behind.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, honey, if you sleep in your own bed tomorrow, we'll do something special, just for you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't believe it took us forty minutes to get here. Why can't they build a stamp museum closer to our house?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, when you've sustained as many blows to the head as I have, consistency is something, something that, something I love you, Bart.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I thought it was twenty.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't believe you're making money off this!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No one's gonna pay a buck to drink water from your hose --,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Butter face.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's bull man.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, and that Dr. Hibbert was so boring... ""Homer, we've got to get that lump checked out... Homer, we must discuss your test results... Homer, we've got to find you a donor..."" blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lisa!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You see, sweetie, when a mommy and a daddy are married for years and have nothing new to talk about, they bad-mouth their closest friends.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, and I spy with my little eye something with four legs that can't run.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Exactly. Now, what has two ears but can't hear?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Tragically, yes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, Marge. But don't be surprised if a snuggle monster shows up.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, he's not showin' up.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, Lisa's room really is scary.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Finally, back in the only safe bedroom in the house.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You know that racecar bed I made him?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The brakes are shot.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Learn to drive, boy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... this is all I could find.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you very little...!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stationary camera.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now Marge, when our little girl's happiness is at stake...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Run, Marge! Start the car!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And you won't... unless you can leap through fire!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lisa! Lisa!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Where's Lisa, boy? This book's gonna solve all her problems.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Although if we were evil spirits, we'd probably assume the shape of your parents.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, we owe her the truth!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, honey, please wake up. If you do, I'll get you a new pony.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... this is still part of your dream. Dreaming... dreaming... now you're awake.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I forgot to floss this morning!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Praise the Lord, I can walk again! What, my foot fell asleep.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, poor Maggie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know, and you did, and you're great.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh. You always gotta work blue, don't ya Marge?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're better than that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can't even go in my own kitchen... Bart's in there right now licking frosting off my eggbeaters.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Noooo! Bart, that's a really bad storage area!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I dunno, maybe. Plus my wife won't let me inside because the baby's got chicken pox.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why would you do that? Are you a bad parent?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So you want Maggie to infect your kids?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And would they pay handsomely for the privilege?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,...Fifteen dollars to infect your kids!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now featuring the Pox Box! Pox box not recommended for pregnant or nursing women. Like any disease box, results may vary. Pox box!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ladies and gentlemen, presenting... the sister with the blisters... the tot with all the spots... Maggie!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now kids, in lieu of one of those inflatable jumping things, please welcome Mr. Krusty the Clown!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Goodbye, thanks for coming. If my party made you sick, tell your friends!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Stomach, are you hungry? I'm always hungry. Now make with the pizza, Fatso. You're the stomach!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I have to do this for work.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, what's happening to me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know. I kept away from Maggie all day.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm so itchy!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmm... Homer-oats.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Y'ello? No, I'm not coming into work. I have chicken pox. I know I said that last month, but I was lying.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Right... right... right... right... okay... right. I love you, bye!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I just got fired. Better check the ""Want Ads.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh! ""Truck drivers needed in Iraq.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Trucks are like big cars.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okey-doke. And you are...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Will she know what this is regarding?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's ridiculous! No woman would want to have sex with that loser! And, uh, congratulations on snagging him back. Good stuff.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This-this is Marge's bra. I bought it for her boobs!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Of all the people for Marge to cheat on, why did it have to be me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, that answers the mystery of the missing melon, but I have one more question: did you sleep with Kirk Van Houten?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I repeat: did you sleep with Kirk?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're not saying no.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm still not hearing no.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, methinks the lady doth protest too much!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gladly.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I came to get my mail.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Resident... occupant... I can't open these. Ooh, a traffic ticket!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'd do anything to get your mother and that donut back.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'd better go.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know the Four Seasons? Well, I'm experiencing them first hand, because I'm living in the park.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I got your note saying you were gonna bring me a bucket of potato salad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where's my bucket?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart! We're all disappointed there's no potato salad! But for God's sake, don't jump!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm a-comin', boy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Make it two kajillion.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We'll lose the first kajillion to taxes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Of course I do. The only thing I can't believe is that a woman as great as you would be married to me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I guess we should count our blessings he's not dead.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow. A robot kid would be a blast. We can confuse him and make his head explode. ""This statement is a lie. But if it's a lie then it must be true. But if it's true, then it must be..."" Kaboom!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, I'm a man who likes to strangle his kids. Do you think I could...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you metal...!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, the windpipe is incredibly responsive!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And he's great with the neighbors.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nice and hot-o, Mr. Robot-o!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"David, you're by far the best son I've ever had. Uh-oh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Replace is such an ugly word. We upgraded.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here, make me a kitty!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, the zoo opens up a whole new world for the animals. In the wild they would never experience boredom, obesity, loss of purpose... you know, the American dream.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm really sorry, but our family just can't handle both of you boys. I hope that somewhere deep in your data banks, you process fond memories of us.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The sad part is, there were times when I actually had feelings for you. I almost felt I was your father.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"David feels, and your mother will agree when I tell her, that it's best for our family if you're no longer in it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No toys!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Heyyy, it's Bart! Super!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You wanted to believe the lie!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Those were my good pants.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This stinks! I've got stubby little robot legs and an ass that's not equipped for an adult diet.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Honey, animals don't feel death. That was proved by the scientists at Black Angus.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They look a little green.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes I am! I mean...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh no! I've been killed!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Outfoxed 'im with the corpse of my best friend. Hee-hee.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge! You saved me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What was that for?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, I can't stay mad at you when that pan smells like sausage and onions.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, are you gonna talk about it, or are you gonna do it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge isn't home.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"They'll bounce back, son. They're a strong people.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ooh! Ooh! I wanna ride the bumper cars!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I call the red one!,,,,,

Homer Simpson,Hmmm. I suppose I could use a little toning.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll give you five dollars for it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I don't hate your mother. I just won't be sad when she dies. Forty-seven, forty-eight...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, sure. Whatever you want. Ninety-five, ninety-six, thirteen, sixty-four, banana...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You want me to ride a whatsickle built for who?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I'm watching television. A lot of people worked hard on this show!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Three hundred and six, three hundred and seven...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Pizza for breakfast!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, Domino's? What do you mean, you're not open? No, you call me back during business hours! I'll show you who's a recorded message!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's the big idea of getting trapped under that thing?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just liftin' this dumbbell.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Forty-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine... fifty thousand!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm pretty happy with this baby, now it's lefty's turn.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wha? Hey, you...",,,,,

Homer Simpson,I'm joining the professional arm-wrestling circuit!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Negatively, I assume.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Gee, she didn't seem angry, or anything. Maybe she doesn't care anymore!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't believe Marge hasn't called me. Maybe I should go home.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Did she say anything else?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Marge, I love her so much.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,He looks tough.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can relate. I've fought that foe and lost many times.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe, I'm starting to have grave doubts about this thing I barely liked in the first place.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Moe. The place for my arm is around my wife.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,SWEET HOME ALABAMA...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"LORD, I'M COMING HOME TO YOU / Alabama!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, spending time with you is more important to me than all the pie-eating contests in the world.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I was in a pie-eating contest on the way home. Now let's go to bed.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That song is a pop music footnote! I didn't say stop!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,'TIS THE SEASON TO BE JOLLY...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kids, this is the holiest night of the year. Tomorrow is Father's Day, and that makes tonight Father's Day Eve.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"JOY TO THE WORLD, A FATHER'S BORN / LET ME RECEIVE GREAT GIFTS!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No Father's Day Eve... does this mean there's no such thing as... Daddy Claus?,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Oh, can I come with you? I know I can't.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What a great Father's Day!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A LeatherBuddy! There's no limit to what I can do with this.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fear not, m'lady! Captain Dash Superstud is here with his small tool!",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Oh, it's heartfelt. There's no escaping that. Thanks, honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no, no, it's great. I'm done with it now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, isn't that cute?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's not my fault! Lousy magnet.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Happy Birthday Dad, From Lisa.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I still don't understand how her feelings can be hurt. It's my day.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,How you doin'? So... is that your jacket on the back of that chair?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Does it still keep hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah, oh sure, it's easy to point out my faults. It's a little harder to shut up.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I know! But how can I undo eight years of jerkiness in two easy sessions at no cost to me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know. What happened to the last Safety Salamander?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can do that!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, Lisa. Time for Daddy's big surprise!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sometimes it's scary when your dreams come true, isn't it, sweetie?",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Bart!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The first rule of bus safety is always wear your seat belt.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then what protects you if we crash?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stop this bus!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, Lisa. I made safety happen!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Safety tip ninety-nine: always double-bolt your easel.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"No, she's not.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Only three?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's more like it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Please, you're embarrassing me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What can I do? I'm only one man.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you sure there wasn't a midget in his hat? I read an email that said there was.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmmm. I will run for Mayor!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I'll find out what a Mayor does!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Expand my brain, learning juice!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I hate press conferences.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, without this outfit, I'm just Homer Simpson, multiple felon. With it, I'm a costumed hero like George Washington or Dame Edna.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Now, I will take your questions.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, there's my X-ray vision, my fire breath... and I can get big laughs with tennis balls.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bloop, bloop, bloop. Bloop, bloop, bloop.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,A little.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, but I swam in it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But aren't you gonna have fun finding out?,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"That's an excellent question, Kent. First of all...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the? It must have shrunk when my wife washed it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's right, I am a man! The man who dressed like a salamander to win back his daughter's love. Let's meet her now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, well, my son is here too. Let's meet him now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Please, stop throwing fruit!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, thanks. Now how 'bout a dance with your Daddy?",,,,,

Homer Simpson,I still feel it. It's so itchy. Itchy...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey! Nobody pushes around my precious bundle of joy! Whoops, wrong one.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll take that... Too slow, Drooly Joe... Peek-a-boo! I steal from you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Silly rabbit... kicks are for ribs!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're like all Easter Bunnies -- can't take a punch to the crotch! Maybe next time you'll think twice before you volunteer to help children. Oh, hey Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ladies. Marge, is there a small rip in my pants?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We throw those out anyway.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, good looking. Wanna snuggle with ""Tyrannosaurus Sex""?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, come on, honey, you have lots of friends. There's, uh... Lisa and...the stove.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Son, I need to find a new friend for your mother. So you're gonna have to finish the shopping yourself.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I wish. I made these at work.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmmm. I bet she'd be a good friend for Marge. She looks defeated too!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Psst. Psst!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Marge, where you goin'?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why does every woman I try to talk to run into cans?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I did it! I found a woman to be your new friend! She's waiting in the living room!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I bet you can't throw a cat over the house.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh. I was wrong.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge... in a gang? What're you gonna do, shoot me with a frosting gun? Seriously, I would love that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute... if she's going bird watching why did she leave our ""Peterson's Field Guide to Birds"" on the kitchen counter?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Roadrunners are real!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, let's see what Marge is up to. ""Recipes,"" ""dress patterns,"" ""toaster undercoating agreement""... ""Heist plans""!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Burns' Mansion?! That's Mr. Burns' mansion!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I gotta stop Marge from doing something reckless and irresponsible.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I wanted to save you from the cops, but the cops followed me! Game over, man! Game over! So, are you gonna introduce me to your friends?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm not!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, well... I try to have a good time.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And tell me I'm not fat.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen, Marge. No matter where you go in this life, you'll always have one friend who loves you body and soul.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Now we have to drive it straight to Rome, where it'll be shipped to Mr. Burns in Springfield.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge... are you encouraging me to be irresponsible?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow! I've seen photos of this, but you can't really experience it until you're here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A McDonald's where you can get booze!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh, there's a picture of it on my cup.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Savages.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let me check the navigation system...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It says that we should turn left at a fat chick in a tu-tu being fed by a midget.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I get it -- the midget represents dwarves.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't worry. We got the cheese insurance.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nooooo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stupid Italy... wish you'd never been unified by Victor Emmanuel the Second... if only you'd stayed a loose confederation of city-states, trading with each other and occasionally warring.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, do you know anything about fixing sports cars?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's a Lamborgotti Fasterosa XT 550 with ABS Sport Tech package.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Americano? What the Hell could that mean? Why can't you people learn to speak my language? I learned to eat your food!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I honor you and your country.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, tell us your story. But it better have a beginning, a middle and an end. And you'd better make us root for the protagonist.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, so far I'm rootin' for ya.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Holy moley!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I always thought you were, you know, ""out loud and proud.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, I never went to college.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, I tell Marge everything! Not necessarily in words, but in body language -- you know, sneaking around and such.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, Bob. We won't tell your beautiful new family that you're a homicidal psychopath -- if you fix up our car.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I thought I was doing Donald Trump.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Prego?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I love you, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sideshow Bob!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's called a hangover, sweetie. And it's an unavoidable part of life.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Burns, we may be experiencing some technical difficulties.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,

Homer Simpson,Uh-oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lazy Romans.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Everyone remember where we parked.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Opera? They have that here too?,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Oh, it's never anybody's decision... anyhoo... I'd like to tell you all a little story I call ""The First Christmas.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A carpenter named Joseph was about to get some frankly preposterous news...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And did you know that little Baby Jesus grew up to be... Jesus?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know, it's weird, isn't it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My God... it's over... We're free!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I said we're free!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I hope I never hear that God-awful nutcracker music again.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I TOLD GRAMPA WE'D BE AWAY,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's great! Now I'll just get my present for you. Which is... right outside the door.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it's just what I wanted. Here, Marge, this is for you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't care what that letter said. This man raised me single-handedly. When I think of all the things he's done for me... the many times he...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lifeguard, huh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So this guy might be my real father, and his name starts with ""M"". Moleman? Mr. Burns? M. Night Shyamalan? That would be a twist worthy of his increasingly lousy films!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The only tummy ache is in my head. I can't stop wondering who my real father might be.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There's only one lifeguard whose name begins with ""M""!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mason Fairbanks...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,His hobbies are philandering... writing letters... and making up for lost time!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, until you're sure this guy's cool, stick to your cover story. Oh, that sounds hard. Just do it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh yes, I'm a reporter with the local paper. I'm doing a story on people who... wear sweaters. Do you mind if I ask you some questions?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Interesting. Interesting.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, I infer from all the knickknacks you're some sort of fruitcake.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that is so cool! Ooh, a dish of shrunken heads!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, you don't have any shrunken heads?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That is small, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh... you know it's a boat, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm sure my listeners would love to know the story behind that name.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No... I said I work for a radio station. Nine-eighty on the AM dial but number one with our viewers!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... well I... I think you're my pappy!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I found this letter you wrote to my Mom, Mona Simpson.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Possible Daddy!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm sorry... I got a little carried away there.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I found my real father! His name is Mason Fairbanks, he has a knife just for cheese, and he talks like this ""Homer, please do that in the loo.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hm, honey, you've given me a lot to think about... tomorrow, when we're on Daddy's boat!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, that story had everything: action, treasure, water, a guy... would you like to come to our house for dinner?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen, old-timer, I'd like you to meet Mason Fairbanks.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mason, come see my room!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who's Mason Fairbanks?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And my dream is to someday wear a real wetsuit instead of one that is just painted on.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ha-ha! That's what you get for being luminous, jerks!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey guys, we found the treasure! When I get to shore, I'm bringin' it right to the bar.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, which way did Mason go? That must be him over there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What do I do? What do I do?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Daddy... daddy...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I drew this picture of you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That is so sweet.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dad...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait. Can we have a moment in private?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"As I lay dying on the ocean floor, I remembered everything you've done for me. To Hell with that stupid DNA test and its ninety-nine point nine, nine, nine, nine, seven per cent accuracy -- you're my dad, and I love you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But how?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Only a true father would lead his son to believe he belonged to someone else.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, Dad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, why don't you stay for dinner.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Send up two hams!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, this one's cold!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Listen... I wanted to ask if you could do something my former father never did for me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Teach me that the stove is hot.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I'm not tired!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You made that TV show really mad.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmm, this camp's got it all -- climbing some kind of rope thing, wearing a backpack, high-fiving the black kid. It's the perfect thing to straighten you out.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey guys, I have to put the boy on a plane to soul-crushing camp, then I'll be back to go to Vegas!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, you don't need to cheat when you got a system.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't tell your mother how much I've lost.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,One child to Portland! He's your problem now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why, there must be some mistake.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah?! You're going to that camp, 'cause I'm gonna drive you there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid Bart... makes me drive to Oregon... home of unspoiled forests... birthplace of Matt Groening ...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You mean Fun Homer? I'm afraid Serious Homer has him locked up till you're at your snooty torture camp.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's no use.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Eh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, if you were half as smart as you think you are, you'd clean up your act.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"At least you have something you're good at. I'm thirty-eight years old, drivin' a crappy car, with a son who doesn't respect me, and I'm one Snickers pie away from losing my foot to diabetes. Mmm, Snickers pie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, I see you're also traveling with your son. What boy prison are you taking him to?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"See Bart, I told you things could be worse.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look at me, I use a napkin.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I bet they're from Massachusetts. You know, it's legal there for a guy to marry his son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't forget to wash your hands, Shakespeare.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, I'll have the smiley-face breakfast special.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, but could you add a bacon nose? Plus bacon hair, bacon mustache, five o'clock shadow made of bacon bits... and a bacon body.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine. But the bacon man lives in a bacon house!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You know who would really like this place? Bart. Wait a minute... where the hell is Bart?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You little monster! Show your face this minute!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, where are you?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm stuck!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow! Someone's hitting my butt with something!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Leave your ass, Homer. Leave your ass.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So Lenny, how's it goin' in Vegas? Pretty boring, I'll bet.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I've got you now, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Boy! Push down on the bumper! Then I can back the car up and save myself.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shower you with love because this experience has taught me just how precious you are.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll kill you! I'll kill your whole family!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kidding! I'm kidding! We can do that, we have a special friendship.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm gonna double kill you! And then I'm gonna bury you in a shallow grave. Then I'll dig you up and kill you again! That's the beauty of a shallow grave.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You sweet little angel. Oh, I'm gonna rip your head off. And spit down your adorable little neck. Because I wanna smash your little stupid head. Oh, but I love you we'll go on a fishing trip. But first I'm gonna put you on a sawmill then punch your little face out. That's what I'm gonna do!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well boy, you made the right choice. I think this is the first step to a new, closer relationship between us.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't enjoy it. Being a father is just a job. Long hours, no pay, and at the end, all you get is someone yelling ""you screwed me up""!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I enjoy you plenty.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Talking time is over.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thank you, Colonel.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Vegas here I come!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I miss Bart! I can't leave him in that awful camp!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm comin', boy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I bet this looks cool from overhead though.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Woo hoo! Vegas here I come! Oh right, Bart.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid horse! It's a deer crossing!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wipe the blood off the windshield and get in the car, boy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, I'm doing something I should have done a long time ago... taking you to Vegas!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And don't you try to stop us.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, normal wear and tear.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Try this one...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, Marge. Me and Bart got in a fight with this really un-cool pit boss, and now we're in Nevada State Prison. Also, I don't know where Bart is. If you see him, say ""hey.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I ripped my pants! The only pants that understand my complex hiney.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow! My ass!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I paid for fifty laps and I'm gonna take them!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll have to go to every store in the pants district to find another pair like these.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"OH, WOULDN'T IT BE ADEQUATE?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Stern, would you make those glorious blue pants again if I whipped up public interest for them?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Through an advertising campaign so fresh and exciting, I haven't even thought of it yet.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How long is this commercial anyway?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's called ""headvertising."" It creates brand awareness without relying on traditional media.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's not supposed to.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,BLUE PANTS! BLUE PANTS!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'M GETTING BLUE PANTS IN THE MORNING / DING DONG THE ZIPPER'S GONNA SHINE...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, it did its job. Everyone's wearing blue pants now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Earning us a hundred bucks a week, that's what. Except the Maine potatoes one. It's just a reminder to myself.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Silly Indians. Our God made their god.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm just gonna get a tiny chip to put on my desk at work.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Save me, Tsisnajini!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm stuck! And I have to pee. Now I'm just stuck.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't leave me! I hate to be alone! Except when I'm watching TV, then leave me alone. But right now, don't leave!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Will you tell me a story?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No unicorns.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait, wait, wait, wait...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now you're telling me Burns's story?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gotcha.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm bald!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey bar-boy, dance around like an idiot. Like this!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm-so-stupid! I'm-so-stupid!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sure! You're gonna be all ""I'm-so-stupid! I'm-so-stupid! I'm-so-stupid!""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Moe has a cappuccino machine??!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, come here and listen to Lisa's story. It's about Moe's treasure!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Moe! Thanks to you, I've been sober a week!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You didn't think it was so horrible when you were falling down the hole.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, it was very moving, but the thing is, bats are chewing my legs!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, why did I lead you down here to find those stupid coins?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I guess I should explain. Not long ago, it was my day to take care of the baby, so I was out in the forest, hiding.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I deduced from his parody lyrics that he was hiding gold in the cave.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I figured he'd never miss two or three pieces. Money which we could use to pay for Bart's operation.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's a story for another day.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I realized I could never find the gold without your help. So I made it this week's family outing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's a lot of little stuff. God has to pay all the elves in his workshop... plus he's got all those planets to support -- you see that ring he gave Saturn?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, Marge. Me and ""Terrible Two"" here are gonna win that computer for you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,'Cause he wants it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now to begin ""Operation: Slight Edge"".",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm winning!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"He's headed for the old mill. No, Cheatie, no!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So many paddles.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Protect the duck! Protect the duck! Produck the tect!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, this race is for rubber ducks, not meat ducks!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! I won!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A living duck! I wished too hard and he became real!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey... that's the same thing you said to Bart after he choked in that soccer game. And we both know he sucked.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just put it in the trunk and leave.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A canoe made of country ham? You know I'll eat it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I heard in study hall you were babysitting tonight.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So Marge, in tomorrow's game I'm gonna recover a fumble just for you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't pressure me. I get enough of that from my Dad.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Old Man Flanders!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Springfield High football rules!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No one turn on the sprinklers, okay?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine. As soon as I finish watching my show.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Old showbiz animals, eh? Do you think any of the gremlins from the ""Gremlins"" movie are there?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I am gonna get them so wet.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sad? You're crazy. I feel like I'm at the Oscars for the animals I forgot existed.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My son's been ape-napped!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Aren't you gonna do something?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But she'll leave the rest of him alone?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you haven't seen Bart for a few hours, so you automatically assume I let something terrible happen.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know what you think: when stupid Homer wasn't looking, Bart got kidnapped by a monkey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And now I'm using sarcasm to confess the whole thing, so later I can say that I already told you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you're so right. I guess I should be more concerned with Bart's safety than covering my own butt. And maybe I'm talking like this because I can't stop. Help me, Lisa! I have serious mental problems!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart! Bart!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"When the monkey falls asleep, I'll sneak you out in this trash bag. Then I'll come back and feed the monkey a peach full of antifreeze.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I fell asleep before the monkey.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Monkey, eat tranquilizer dart!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, monkeys don't have feelings. If they did, then my experiments could be called cruel.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, Toot-Toot and her son escaped!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mr. Teeny?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I am so stoked about Lenny's party. He said he's gonna make a surprise announcement!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why the hell would he want to do that... blessed sacrament that has made my life so rich? I like your hat, sweetie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I mean the one at the house.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my God!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How did Lenny get to be Newsfake Magazine's Man of the Year?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?! Next you'll be telling me he didn't meet Woody Woodpecker!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lenny, this TV is amazing. If you're not careful, I might just spend the rest of my life on your couch.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're right, Lenny. I...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lenny! Bring me a beer and your deepest chamber pot! Chop-chop!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look at that picture quality -- you can see the soulless emptiness in that shark's eyes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooo, ""Two and a Half Men!"" You can see the soulless emptiness in Charlie Sheen's eyes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Later, if I have enough energy, we can walk up to the TV and I'll show you how thin it is.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah, well right there's a commercial with a dancing cold sore.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, I can actually feel the heat.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can you at least take a picture of me with the TV?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah, good times.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid non-plasma TV. Picture so blurry. Might as well rub dirt in my eyes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh Marge! I love you! I love you! I love you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,There's a chance we won't win?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My collection is complete. Forty years of the Family Circus.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,They'll never let me near Lake Havasu again.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm signing us up for a reality show where we trade you to another family.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Marge, you're the greatest mom ever. I want the whole world to see that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh really? Bart, when did you get your tenure?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, well I have full tenure.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll bet the twist is he's gay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Because we'll be on TV, and earn enough money to buy a TV. TV.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, TV-sa?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen up, Stonehenge. I made a drawing of the places on Marge you can't touch. Especially the hair.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You take forever to say nothing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ya know, you don't seem like the money-hungry semi-stripper who's usually on Fox. Why'd you do it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I see. Well, I should be getting to the living room...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, he didn't get the prize pig at the fair, either.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, that's how I feel about Notre Dame football.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know why I ever married that woman.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, okay.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There's this guy that got killed -- I think it was in Miami? So C.S.I. Miami investiga-ted-ed it. Then a family said how much they loved the Olive Garden. Then I fell asleep. When I woke up, Letterman was talking to Alias.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's that delicious smell?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,She's nowhere to be seen. Time to let Homer be Homer.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Marge, thank God you're back! She made me spend time with the kids. And not just TV time. Talking time!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maggie? She's in her crib.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So it would appear. However, Cousin It, there, was born a woman.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, well, I'm gonna vote ""No"" on Thirty-eight so you can't adopt.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Kidding! Kidding! I don't vote! The polling place is up a hill and I never make it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,YOU MAKE ME LAUGH / YOU MAKE ME CRY / WITHOUT YOU I'D JUST / WANT TO DIE / FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE / YOU'LL BE A FIXTURE / NOW LET ME ENJOY / YOUR PICTURE IN PICTURE...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And Marge, you're pretty great too.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I thought it was about her boobs.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Tonight on Jock Center: a slugger on 'roids, Tiger Woods is annoyed, and North Korean missiles deployed!",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Okay, Apu said his cousin Kavi could help me out.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Let's see... Apu's cousin is medium height, dark complexion, brown eyes, black hair...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you Kavi?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you Kavi?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Finally.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry I'm late. I was doing Carnak with my bodyguard.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hindu. What do you call the moisture on your Hin?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh... duh... uh... um... uh... duh... Did I say ""um""?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay book, I didn't read you, and you didn't read me, but we're both in this together, so say something smart or get ready to run like hell. Um... ""In business as in breakfast, fried eggs have fragile yolks... huh, huh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just outsource it to Lisa. Outsourcing is the answer to everything.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Outsourcing!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, a little book once told me...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,...having only one pancake leaves room for more bacon.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're giving me absolute power?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm not a God. God has a white beard and invented the Da Vinci Code.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmmm, let's see. You got the Elephant Man, Johnny Six-Arms, Papa Smurf... these guys are pretty cool. Maybe I am one of them. If only I had some kind of proof.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I won a free soda! I am a god!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"See, it goes: ship's wheel, Popeye tattoo, Gilligan hat, fish with boobs... and back to ship's wheel.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My life's work ruined.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,Hide me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Please, you've gotta help me! If they find me they'll kill me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Lord, please let the soldiers kill this family instead of me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, thou art a widow, eh?! Then the codpiece holds no terrors for thee.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh baby...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What kind of a booze cruise is this? Where's the hooch?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stupid Flandish. Uh, listen, since all the other fun stuff is out of bounds, how 'bout a little Bible-thumping in the crow's nest? What do you say, Miss...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,She's gonna marry him 'cause he wears boots instead of blackening his feet.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Man, that bird did it all. Good guy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Land ho!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I do!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I guess we have time for my tale of moist adventure. It takes place in a dark time for mankind when madness and ignorance ruled: ""the nineteen seventies.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"My wig! I mean, my natural hair!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've got an idea: climb into my mouth.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nooooo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Catch me, Flanders!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! It's almost New Year's! Ten... nine... eight...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,...three... two... one... Happy New Year! My resolution is to be more fun!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, gimme a second, I'm in the bathroom.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What? I have great ass suction. Now how 'bout a little privacy?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My keys!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, I can see this is all up to me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Swim, fatty, swim!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't tell me what to do.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my God, our boat is upside down!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Or will ever do.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, it says here ""the book"" was written by Tom Stoppard. This isn't a book, it's a play! Book.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, check it out, I'm Scratcher or something.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They're gonna divide the school in two?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, you know what a man invented? Actual paper.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Which goes great with another male invention -- the car.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Let's see, men also have: rocket ships, suspension bridges, constitutional government, snow shoes, brass knuckles...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Pinball machines, the Renaissance...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, why did women invent sleeping on the couch?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, who's the rude dude with the attitude?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You seem cool. Wanna catch a movie?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let's not fight in front of my cool new friend.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So... do you wanna ""wang chung"" tonight?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, uh... uh... Honey, you're just as smart as a man. Sometimes when I'm with you, I feel like I'm doing it with a dude.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I won't be lonely. I can always cuddle with the dog.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,At least everyone knows I'm smarter than you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How did this happen?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Screw you! I'm never gonna pay!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fine! I'll finish it myself. And don't think I'm gonna screw it up, because I won't!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But sweetie, I just wanted to tell the '74 Oakland A's how I felt about them.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My work here is done.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm needed at the door!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Seventy-four? Oh sorry, there's been a mistake.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"On second thought, I am Brenda Wine cooler.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, all our mail has ever brought me is bad things: bills, jury duty, Entertainment Weekly. Now, for once, I'm getting' rich-person mail. You wouldn't take that away from me, would you, son?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay Weingartens, what else is in your mail?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh! Marge, you wanna go to a wedding of a couple we never met?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mark and Tracy, I remember the first words I heard you say: ""I do.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Take that, liberal media.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I don't have to sit here and listen to your insane ravings about me getting other people's mail.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,She's opening her eyes!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,She doesn't recognize us!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You monster! What have you done to my face?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,When will Marge remember us?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Jogging?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sweet!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Jogging?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm gonna take care of you until your amnesia goes scram-nesia. I got you flowers a fluffy pillow...and a nice, relaxing private room.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm your husband!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I am! We're the same age!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I do eat a lot of crap.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Great news, Marge -- we're goin' home.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but he's cool with it. Right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now the doctor said a tour of the town could help bring back your memory.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Those ""freaks,"" as you call them, are some of our closest friends.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"See that ball of fire? That's the sun. It goes by many names: Apollo's Lantern, Day-moon, Old Blazey. The important thing is never to touch it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, now you do.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'd better get ready -- I'm next!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, Marge... time to remember Admiral Awesome!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why do you remember them and not me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay. All it'll take to unlock your memories of me is one of these blasts from the past.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here's me fighting with former President Bush, me fighting with current President Bush, and here's me showing a bag of apples who's boss.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, maybe if we snuggle, it might rattle some memories loose.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"When a man and a woman love each other very much, they--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But what if we...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You used to love my non sequiturs!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh no, Bart and Lisa are gonna tell me something horrible!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, if I can't make you remember me, then I'll make you fall for me all over again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The heart is the symbol for love.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So beautiful. I wish I could understand Italian.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just wait. We're coming to the site of our most romantic night ever!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It was in that plywood castle that we first... well, you know...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh you loved it -- especially when the windmill came around and whacked your but.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, it was the happiest night of my life! The warm Spring air, the swings I took in the batting cage afterwards... Don't you remember, darling?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know. Wait, I thought of another way: I stay!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I realize you've made up your mind, and I want you to know that I deeply respect your boo!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I know. I just thought maybe... boo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Boo.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, the rest of your life for sure.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That might be Marge!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I sure have, pardner.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh no! He's Marge's, and my, dream man! I've gotta make a play for her now or I might lose her forever!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,At least she's found someone who can make her happy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You idiot!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do you know what you just gave up?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The wisest, wettest man you'll ever meet.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You just walked away from the sweetest, most beautiful woman a guy could want. In ten years she never had the last slice of pizza and she's never complained. Every election, she wishes she could vote for both guys, because they both seem nice. And there's a light inside her that makes everyone else look better. And you blew her off.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really? Well she's still great!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm so happy we're together again. Wanna get a drink?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, yeah. I started when you were in the hospital. I was so worried. Recently I tried this thing called ""beer."" And...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But do you also remember that you're an enabler?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And her?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And her.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What about him?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, I have their baseball cards.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look at all those people. You know them?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, she's over in post now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not me -- but we can't get rid of him, 'cause he's friends with Richard Sakai.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, he ain't gettin' married. He has commitment issues!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"When you get to third base, I'll buy ya a beer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right. Just this once you can take a drink out of my special water bottle.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo-hoo! Weapons!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't start the exhibit without me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look at that line.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Time to do what I do best -- ruin it for everybody.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Flanders! Thanks for saving our place.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw dude, I was totally here. You calling me a liar? In front of my kids? 'Cause I'd take a bullet for you, man. Right in my mouth!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no you don't!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm everywhere.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, this 3-D is amazing! You can actually feel the vase!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Flanders. But when you get in, you can use my audio tour. Narrated by Melanie Griffith.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Good riddance. Their drawings suck and they look like hippies.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My mind is always open to new ideas.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Onions in the peas! What the hell?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is the break in the case we've been waiting for!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Poor Bambi... poor Thumper...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I love it when you're not into it. Oh yeah, baby. Oh yeah that's it ignore me. I'm not even here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, Marge. It's not a twist-off!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,C'mon...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,C'mon! Open! I want what's in you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You, stupid...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh wait, it was a twist-off.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now you can only see butts on cable.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The Isotopes are winning? To the bandwagon!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nothing beats a day at the ballpark with my family.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Tickets, tickets, who needs tickets?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, I'll use the money I make to buy tickets from a scalper. Then I'll sell those tickets, and we'll be rich! Rich! We did it, baby! We made it through the rain!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Tickets, thirty dollars! Big game, everyone wants to see the game...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cop! Act like you're in love with me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart! Hand me that sack of batteries!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nine Volt! Double A! D!-D!-D!-D! Cordless drill!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look at that ugly old man.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really? You'd kiss an ugly old man like me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What a game! I got on the kiss-cam, I participated in ""the wave,"" and I got to pee in a trough! Marge, can we get a trough?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, iced tea!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Buck Mitchell!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, yes. The game you played so horribly at.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Season tickets?! I could entertain business clients. I might even land the Henderson account!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sure. That means she wants to talk in private. It's probably about you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, we've gone through more hardships than the Jews and Charlie Brown put together.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's just how I feel.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Buck Mitchell!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry I'm late! I was just gathering my counseling equipment.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now let's remember: no one's right, and no one's wrong, till I say so.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, I think we've really hit on something here. Unfortunately, we're out of time. How does that make you feel?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Shut up, my ten o'clock's here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Interesting, interesting....",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Buck, you've got a beautiful woman with a hot body that any man would fantasize about, even while making love to his own Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good idea, honey. Buck, would you mind signing a couple of baseballs for my boy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just sign your name above President Lincoln's.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I say a monkey can mow our lawn!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I stole a rack of fur coats. I sell one a year to pay for Christmas.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why, 'cause I'm fat?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Like I always say: compromise is the key.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let's compromise and say nobody said it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Tabitha, great show. I like that part where you mentioned Springfield. Did you know that's where you are?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you're so hot.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,If only I'd seen you before I met my wife.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't tell the hamburger in my car.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, why didn't you marry one of your crummy backup dancers?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thank God I brought protection.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I used to be so embarrassed buying these.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, we're gonna have a lot to talk about at your three o'clock.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cancellations require twenty-four hours No-tice.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, they beat me up at work. Look at the word they wrote on my skull.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I didn't want you to learn that word this way.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, we've gotta get Buck and Tabitha back together. This is the most important case of our careers!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, so now we're judging each other based on things we've done. Real fair. Class act.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm going back to the stadium to bring those two kids back together. And I'll do it with or without you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I wanted to do it with you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's working! Buck's buying my fake message! And you said it would never work.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... she was here a minute ago. She must be pooping.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Great. But enough of the baseball analogies. They sicken me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, m'lady, your carriage awaits.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, your paintings have brush marks and your statues have wieners!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"He's talkin' like the guy in ""Fat Albert."" Howba areba youba?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whyba youba doba thatba?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mmm, this must be what angels taste like!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why can't you do anything?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dirt nap, eh? Hm...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Marge, can't hear ya!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is all my daughter's fault. But I'll make it up to you. Bart and I will run your business till your Dad's okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Everything. And I learned it all from the greatest gangster film ever: ""Shark Tale"".",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Leave him to me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow! I hurt my fist and my palm. I thought you guys were lookin' out for me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, tap jockey, you owe Fat Tony fifty bucks. Cough it up!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just get the money.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay. Take it, take it! Just don't hurt me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay pretty boy, where's Fat Tony's fifty bucks?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It'll do for now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, it fell off a truck. You know, a truck-truck.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No problem. I'll be back in ten minutes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You monster! Just cut his Achilles tendon with this knife.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But this is the only life I know!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can I still talk with my hands?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What about with my ears?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lady. Man. Lady. Man. Lady.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, if I poisoned them, would I be doing this?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, could you let it go? You won. She's dead!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, put a leash on him, lady!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Spare us your medical mumbo-jumbo! Just give us the pills. Clear-cut his brain down to the nub!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thank you, Doctor. Marge?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've never seen him happier.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I know -- I'll use that white-noise machine I got you when your father died.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Transport yourself to the shores of Nova Scotia, where cod and halibut frolic in--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So it's a noise war he wants, huh? Then I'll throw in some rush-hour traffic!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And a circus fire!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sleep tight, my angel!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh! Let me know when and if you want sex, honey!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, get dressed. You're going to a jazz brunch, as punishment for all the racket you're making!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm sending you mixed messages! Now get the Hell outta here!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I love you so much. Damn you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Woo hoo! What's next? A contract with Groove-tone Records? Take the G-train, baby. Groove-tone!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, son. I like you more, now that other people like you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And then today at lunch Lenny and I went to the park and rented a rowboat. Carl sketched us from the bank. Summer days.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And what about my new job as a Mexican wrestler?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Beware of el Taco Belly!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No mas! No mas!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not if I can help it, Lisa!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, no. sorry if it sounded like I did.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I guess.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Deal!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, gummy worms!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't tell me how many times to think!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then stand back!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This doesn't taste like I thought it would.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We already own a book!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Cool, a carpenter's library!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This doesn't look easy, but I'll bet it is.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah? Blah blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Blah blah blah, blah blah blah...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, now you do me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I did! I made a foot rest.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's the point? We're all slowly dying.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You sure are, sweetie -- I love this bed you made.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yep, it'll do that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Simpsons Manly-Man Handyman at your service.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No problem. Why don't you go inside and stir your flubber while I get to work.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, the coast is clear.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, uh, that was me. You know that old saying: ""measure like a girl, hammer like a guy.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, uh... you know what they say, ""hammer with the wood and it's all good.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's allll good.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,...Annnd done.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Listen... what would you say if I told you a woman did most of the work?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh... Like all manly men, I have a vivid imagination.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmm... extra-virgin...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Of course I can make a credenza, whatever that is. Just give all the details to my secretary Shirley.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That Shirley is quite a gal. We should fix her up with Barney.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, giving me credit was your idea. Now could you rub my butt? I sat on it so much it's a little sore.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, I'm sorry you're upset. But if we tell the truth now, I'll be humiliated in front of the whole town. Then you won't be married to a man. You'll be married to some kind of gay jellyfish, floating outside the Florida Keys, cruising for rich snorkelers. You don't want that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,He wants to grind his own corn. Maybe it'll finally shut him up about the high price of cornmeal.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Switch!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Who'd you think would help me, my wife? Heh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, I hear it too. Maybe we can cover it up by singing a fun song. ""WE WILL, WE WILL ROCK YOU...""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, infinity. I never expected them to climb on the cabinet and ride it down the biggest hill in town.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, I understand that you're mad. Which makes now the perfect time to tell you the mayor's hired us to fix the old Springfield roller coaster.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"By the way, nice job installing this wall-chart bracket. If the kids ask, I did it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now as I see it, the problem with this roller coaster is there are too many boring ""going-up"" parts.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We need to replace them with kick-ass ""going-down"" parts.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmm... let me mull that over.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What are struts?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know anything about struts.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I promised these guys money I don't have! And they're gonna be so mad!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maybe I can sneak home without them seeing me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sweetie, you don't understand. If I can do this myself, then all those lies I told will be true. Don't you want Daddy's lies to be true?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"To Daddy, the real world gets fainter and fainter every day.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, honored guests, and out-of-town roller-coaster weirdoes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And now I give you... the Zoominator!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And now to get stinking drunk!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sure, I'll tell them the truth...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The truth is that I'm perfect and everything I touch is perfect!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've never felt saferrrr!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh. Oh. Why must we preserve America's historic roller coasters?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thank you honey!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Everyone! My stupid male pride made me lie to you. Everything I claiiimed I did was actually built by Maaarge!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Avenge me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I realized something when I was trapped under all that rubble: marriage is the real roller coaster. I'm just glad I have you as my safety bar.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, that's great. Let's look at it after.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You always find an excuse not to make out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, a space marshmallow!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where do you think you're going?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If he's so smart, how come he can't stay outta my mouth?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I ate it, it's over.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh no you don't!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,If I can keep down Arby's I can keep down you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Must eat, then poop, then eat some more, then eat while pooping.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Still hungry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Son! Let me have a lick at you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nag, nag, nag.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, no. Just gas.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, teenagers... No! Today's teens have enough problems, without me eating them.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll savor you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Beer-battered Germans...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Must eat more fat people. Thank God I'm in America!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I used to think these shirts were just for fat slobs.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dr. Phil McGraw!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're right. Starting tomorrow, no bread before dinner.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's ridiculous, talking fudge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge! I missed you! All this eating has put me in the mood for a little lovin'.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, back to the drawing board.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What happened to ""for better or for worse?!""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's amazing. He tastes just like Jeffrey Tambor.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, to keep you in my life, I'd do anything. There must be some way to turn my problem into a positive for the community.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, there's something I have to tell you father to son. I passed out on your turtle and killed it. Someday you'll thank me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Milhouse.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's goin' on?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey boy, where's your mud buddy? I have a little job for him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, get him a woman. That'll end his misery!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This hurts so much.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Writing's for nerds.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I'm not done dancin'! This bulletin better swing!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Flanders?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, it's a war of the worlds. Good thing we've got the sun on our side.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Go ahead and hide, you coward!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Burn everything!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's alien talk!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm proud of what I achieved during my rioting.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It was either kill him or kill no one!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, that was just a radio show.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh, big deal -- by the time Bart's eighteen, we're gonna control the world! We're China, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, guys. You know, his mother's the one who made me come down here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Go on.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wouldn't that take me away from my family for two whole years?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Where do I sign?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now where's my parade? Where's my parade?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, ""Who makes what in America."" Army private: fourteen thousand a year.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I have to Marge. Who else is gonna keep oil under a hundred dollars a barrel?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You? Don't make me laugh! You couldn't--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, no, daddy's just teasing. Of course you could. You could keep it under a hundred. Yes, you could.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No she couldn't.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you gonna ask us our major malfunctions? 'Cause mine is I care too much.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Snowflake?! What happens to me in the summer?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't understand. How does punishing them teach me a lesson?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man, you've got an awesome voice.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Can you say ""Side effects may include drowsiness and loss of appetite?""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hm, sounded better in my head.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Everyone got an assignment but us.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I wonder what makes us so special.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's an odd way to start handing out medals.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are we that stupid?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nope. I'm gonna stay here and let them test their laser-guided super weapons on me -- like that one!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, these are war games and I'm head of my team. I have to think like a great military leader.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I will!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stay crunchy, men! Stay crunchy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my God, I just remembered. It's Chinese New Year!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gung hay fat choi! Gung hay fat choi!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Americans!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bring it on, chumps!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fingers, fingers, fingers!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe, Moe, you gotta hide us from the Army!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not that Army, the one from ""Stripes!""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, Moe. How can I ever repay you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, what have we got?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Rise my pretties! Find our enemies and capture their image in your filmy fortress!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm not gonna surrender. You've seen what the U.S. Army does to prisoners. How would you like to be stacked naked in a pile with a hillbilly girl pointing at you and laughing?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, Marge always loves your cards. Well, you may not be the smartest guys in the Army...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"H means ""hot""?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stupid Army, searching for me with that giant helicopter in the distance.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Predator drone!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmm... Let's see what your hangover has to say!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dudes! Wanna make some extra spending money? Get a free pair of boots? Hey baby, you like obstacle courses?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thinking it over, huh? I'm cool with that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, pal. Like the way you handle that mop. You like killing? Hey, ladies. Are you tired of waiting for sanctions to work? I know I am.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmm... I must be supposed to remember something.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, memory, wake up!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Is it our anniversary? No, we don't have one this year. Hmmm...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't forge? Don't forge what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ohhh, don't forget. Don't forget what?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The Senior Olympics? That's what I was supposed to remember?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Too late. The deed is done.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This guy sucks. He can barely make it to the top.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I was supposed to take Moe fishing today! Everybody hide!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Says you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whoa, Marge, who'd you piss off?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe, you live in a hotel? You're just like ""Eloise""!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This vibrating massage chair feels great!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, Moe's a poet! He has a soul! Flutter your wings! It's teatime in Buttercup Junction!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Moe's the Princess of Lollipop Land! He lunches on lavender and potpourri!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Seriously Moe, I think you have a gift.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, you love a man!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do not mention that publication in this house! They never published my poem!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There once was a rapping tomato / That's right, I said rapping tomato / He rapped all day / From April to May / And also, guess what, it was me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, a family trip with the family bartender -- what could be better?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lousy. I gotta go to Vermont for some stupid poetry thing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine. I'll drive between sips.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"They got an open bar at this thing, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow. Troopers from every state in New England.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's gonna be awesome!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man, couples in this state sure like to clink glasses.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, thanks for the heads-up! We'll see ya when we see ya!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I love these covered bridges. It's like driving through cute little houses.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh I'm sorry. We should exchange insurance information. I have none.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And we went to the ""Vermont Teddy Bear"" factory. Look what we got! Hm? Hm?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh honey, don't cry. They're not made from real bears -- just their fur and noses!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No one makes my daughter sob and run.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Make my daughter cry, will ya! Eat syrup, jerk!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, not now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmmm... maple syrup. Sleigh on the label, very good.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Rich maple color, good swirl...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Jemima!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm the king of goofing off!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I thought we were playing Cincinnati Time-Waste.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What'd I do?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Marge, want a thousand dollars?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're not ice cream... faker!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ice cream man! Wait!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ice cream man! Ice cream man!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"One butter-crusted choco-rocket, please.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, this economy is tough on everyone. Change a hundred?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nooooo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Max told you about me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is the most fun I've ever had giving you wood.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute. You don't want the truck, I need a job, you need money, I'm flush with severance pay...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why, doesn't he need it? Oh, right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Remember that crappy ice cream truck I bought?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, sink your crooked rotting teeth into this!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,He was following my design.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And now to get dressed in a most unusual way:,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Butter-brickle!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You kids like ice cream?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What's the matter, son? Don't you have enough money for ice cream?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, I will not stand for intolerance!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You give this delightful frozen treat the same respect you would give any lactose-free food. God bless America!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I said, God bless America!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ooh! Thomeone wearth a brathelet. Who'th your boyfriend? Dr. Osterberg?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whoa Marge, for the first time in my life, I'm excited about going to work!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're glad? You don't look glad. Are you sure you know what glad means?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Love you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I... Folk art!? That's my favorite kind of folk medium!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you're a genius. You should make sculptures of other people! Like Lenny, or Carl, or the new James Bond. Will America accept a British James Bond? I can't wait to find out!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Honey, I brought you more sticks.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's good to see you smile again. I was lonely being happy all by myself.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let me just put on some romantic music.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, we got the whole night, baby -- let's slow things down.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, everything looks wonderful!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm off to pedal my frosty wares!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sweetie, I can't abandon my route even for one day. If those kids discover the link between eating right and feeling good, I am screwed. But I'll be back in time for your show.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I would never let you down. Our marriage is like soft-serve ice cream. And trust is the hard chocolate shell that keeps it from melting onto our carpet. In cone-clusion, here's the scoop: I love you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What the hell do you kids want? Oh right, ice cream.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my God! It's the opportunity of a lifetime!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Attention, losers: this is your chance to buy your kids some frozen love.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, I'm all out of ice cream.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge's show!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Must jettison excess weight!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my God, I've only got nine seconds till Marge's show!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll never make it! Unless...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! I'm gonna be on time!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I made it back for your show, honey...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, let me explain: I had a chance to make a little more money by exploiting broken families...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well excuse me for having enormous flaws that I don't work on!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge? Marge?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Honey, you've been in there all day. You gotta eat something. Why don't you come downstairs and cook dinner? Lasagna would be awesome. Marge?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I wrote you a check for three hundred dollars to pay for all the sculptures I broke. Okay?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I see. You'd prefer a wire transfer. What's your routing number?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's okay, I can get it from the bank, honey. I just need to know your birthday.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge? I have an apology that I hope is better than all the other ones. So please listen carefully. The thing I liked best about being an ice cream man wasn't the free ice cream, or the colorful toppings, or the love I received from obese children. It was giving you those sticks, and watching you smile as you turned them into art.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If it would win you back, I would gradually eat all the parts of a motorcycle. I hope it doesn't come to that. Could you please just give me a sign that you still love me a little?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If you won't talk to me, I'll send in Polaroids to show you how sad I am that I let you down.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm laughing in the last one, but it's only 'cause the cat fell down the stairs.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, where are you? Did you change your name? Is it Kelly? Kelly!!!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my God. She's gonna jump. Marge, don't do it! Give divorce a chance!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The world's not that interested!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow! You made me a sculpture of Magilla Gorilla.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I just have one question, my darling: what did you do with all the ice cream that was on all those sticks?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah? Well I wish I'd married Patty and Selma!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You used to love it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Recording that fake fight was a great idea.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And, as always, have fun watching.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,GOOOO... LOVEMAKING!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And I hate the cutesy way you make Jack-o-lanterns! I like scary Halloween, not funny Halloween!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, your elbow's like an angel's kiss. But you still have to go.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, we all have to do things we don't want to. Like have jobs and families and responsibilities, and having to be Mr. Funny all the time -- You think I wouldn't rather be living nude in the forest? Like some ancient pagan! Just dancing around playing the pan flute! And here we are!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Too late.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah. How'd you afford this kick-ass party?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Marital sex!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, tucked in tight, glass of water, nightlight on, no barn owls, don't do drugs, love you, good night.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But your mother smells like coconut!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay sweetie, which book should I read?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah, this is that fantasy book that even grownups like. Broken, lonely grownups.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Chapter One: The RubyStone in the Door-Portal. Are you asleep yet?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Angelica trembled as she looked up at the stern but wise whiskers of Headmaster Greystash...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, wake up! They're taking Angelica to Mount Purgatorium.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Tomorrow? But she's in trouble now! I'll just read ahead without you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, of course. Whatever you say, sweetie. Nighty-night.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, I'm home! Time for me to read to you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lady, you're nice, but I'm married.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow! I can't read ahead -- I promised Lisa I wouldn't!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,An Unexpected Occurrence?! What could it be?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Angelica was trapped in the Suffoclock of Sandy Doom...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,...As Headmaster Greystash fought a battle to the finish with dark wizard Maluicious Krubb.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He killed Greystash!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Greystash. Greystash! Oh, hello, Lisa.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... how would you feel if something bad happened to Greystash?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Angelica was trapped in the Suffoclock of Sandy Doom...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Greystash looked Krubb right in the eye and said...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The end.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, they went to Star Wars Land and fought star wars.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now Lisa won't know about death till it strikes someone close to her.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Greystash! Greystash!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't say his name! In your mouth it sounds like dirt!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No man should outlive his fictional wizard! No man!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just think, Lisa, if I had paid for those skating lessons, that could've been you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look out! It's the Grumple!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Give back that Holiday Cheer, you bastard!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're getting a cab, old man. In fact, I believe I see it now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Your present is leaving.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, we have a problem here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do you think that's the same Grumple from the ice show? Because I do.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why did you let that loser into our home?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Christian Charity? What does a porn star have to do with this? He's gotta go!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really? Who's gonna make him?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He sure has a lot of markers that don't work.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, I make six of those a year.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lower the boom!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Has the boom been lowered?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We're not keeping that moocher in this house another minute!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that's it -- we're changing doctors.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, admit it -- you just can't say ""no"" to anyone. That's why you have three kids.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes we are.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I have no idea what you were just thinking about. Why would you think I did?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but there's something else. There's this loser staying in our house. Marge says she's gonna kick him out, but then she never does.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I guess I'll have to wait for Marge to show some backbone and-- You again?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the hell is this thing?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Those legs go on forever. Oh wait, they stop right there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A heart-shaped box of chocolates.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"For your information, since I bought it I put on a ton of weight.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Their drunken singing is ruining St. Patrick's day!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Scottsdale? Will we stay at a Tripletree Resort?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then forget it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gunderson!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And to think, he and I once shared a shower.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A hundred and seventeen degrees! Ooo, that reminds me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,There's water under the seat!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now remember, Marge, we're not buying anything for more than one-point-two. But if I scratch my nose, that means we can go to one-point-five.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've never seen Marge want to go somewhere so badly. I'm gonna take her back there... by burning that home movie onto a DVD.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've never seen Marge like a DVD about a place so much. I'm gonna make her dream come true... by downloading that movie onto her iPod.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm sorry I couldn't figure out how to get that movie onto your iPod... so I'm taking the family on a surprise vacation to Barnacle Bay!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We left plenty of food so you won't starve.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I was talking to the cat!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Marge, I'm sure it was just some guy filled with hate.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You could caramel my arm...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I didn't say ""stop.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's not sugar, it's caramel!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I bet it was Bill Clinton's fault.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Slick Willie wiggles out of another one.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I can't stand to see your mother unhappy. But this town could be great for your mother again. And I know three people who can make it happen.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nice brush work, Emily. Nathaniel, you could learn a lot from her.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Ma-arge, we have a surpri-ise! Come to the win-dow! And look down at the stre-et!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, they're getting a little exercise.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All night long, baby.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Blue pinwheel, red pinwheel, big white ball, wait for the ""aaahhh...""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A green spinner to build suspense... and then the big finale, the:",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, so, forming an angry mob, eh? Who we goin' after?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think the hook is touching my brain. .,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dammit!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Queer strange or queer gay?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How many yum-yum fish did we get?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ew, it tastes terrible!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Finally. Something even I wouldn't eat. Well, maybe a little more.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Terrible.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Here you go -- beer-battered shrimp.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh... I thought today was Opposite Day. By the way, you're very ugly. It's Opposite Day.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So that means... it is Opposite Day.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know what to say.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dear Marge, how are you? I am fine. The waves here are way bigger than the ones at home. And the salt water is rising. What's next? Pepper water? Ha ha. Love ya, Homer Simpson.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart!? What the hell are you doing in there?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You did the right thing, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Watch me drive a golf ball off the bow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeahhhh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shiiiii... pwreck!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh... sure we will, son. Right, Captain?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Should I hit him with a shovel to spare him the pain of drowning?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's the code word?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh mother sea -- giver of fish, taker of boats, toilet to the world, the Greeks called you Poseidon, the Romans... Aquaman. Look into thy starfish heart and protect our souls, so we might live to go tubing on thee again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do you think your Mother will ever remarry?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The hell we are!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, handsome here was in big trouble...when suddenly...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my God! It's beautiful!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute. How am I breathing?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then when all seemed lost...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't go back to living on the surface world! I can't!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then they brought us home...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, that's our story. Oh wait, we were attacked by a giant whale. He turned out to be pretty cool.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ah! Nothin' beats taking a family drive with our new satellite radio.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Which of the twenty-five easy-listening stations should we listen to?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're all idiots. I'm putting it on Chill Thunder Lite.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey! Nobody cuts me off!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How's it goin'?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then what's America doing in Iraq?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,May we? May we? Mais oui!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Treason?! But I love France! The way all our words are either a girl or a guy! Oh, that's the best!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't want the kids to see me this way!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I didn't write that! Even if I did love England, I'd play it cool. Wait for it to come to me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You moron! I'm already alive!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I shouldn't be here, I was framed!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you gonna torture me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nine a.m.?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I swear revenge on Meaux! Even if it takes me the rest of my life! Can you loosen my arm so I can shake my fist?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,REVENGE! Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, little mouse, you are the only thing that keeps me sane.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now I have nothing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where did you come from?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh sorry, I wasn't listening. I was checking out my reflection in this yellow water. Lookin' good.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And decrepit.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, the the! But why are you helping me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So this map leads to a treasure, huh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I wonder how long this tunnel...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,...iiiiiis!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mon Dieu! Weee!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ew! Silver!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, a penny!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is my lucky day.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Madame, you have the shapely, hairless knuckles of a queen.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Monsieur Meaux, I would be honored if you would be the first to enjoy the evening's entertainment.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Here it is: The Harmless Chair of Relaxation!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Little do you know that the Count of Monte Cristo is in fact an old acquaintance of yours.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I have returned!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh. Hold on.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oui oui! And I have spent the last five years plotting the most exquisite revenge!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, my love?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You guys liked him?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, I did it all for you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It takes time to make a revenge machine this awesome! Plus, in the middle, I had to take revenge on some of my contractors.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, right -- revenge!!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm gonna get my revenge! And if I get caught, I'm pinning it on the baby like the time I shot Mr. Burns.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Is it ""The Count of Monte Cristo?"" 'Cause I love that story.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow. That had what I really like in a story: an ending.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, sweetie. The lesson is: never put down your weapon.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Revenge!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This is it. It's taken all day, we've missed our flight to Hawaii, but finally, I'll get my revenge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You? You're too dumb to tell a story.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, seriously, you're great -- let's hear it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Parents who are still alive, I might add.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You don't frighten me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Or my wife!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Or my...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Avenge me. In flamboyant impractical fashion.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's okay, boy. The two of us got to talking.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Two.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know. Let's just lay here till we figure it out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now what do they want?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Camera's broken!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I can't believe this day is already here: me taking you for your first driving lesson.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, that jerk cut us off! Pull alongside!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eat Marshall Tucker, idiot!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Floor it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whoa, you just blew my mind!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's your hurry?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, my little girl's just like CBS News.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hold on there, boy. If you wanna keep using that car, you'd better start pullin' your weight.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This cell phone is so I can call you whenever I need your driving services. I've put in my own ring tone!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, Bart?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I need you to go the gas station. Tell them you need to inflate your tires, but actually you inflate these volleyballs.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then throw them over the wall of the prison to create chaos and confusion.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart... buddy! It's your dad! I need a ride! I think I'm in Chinatown. Not our Chinatown.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, I don't wanna freak you out, but I'm calling from inside the trunk.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That was me. Some very un-cool people put me in here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's dark in here!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart! This is a matter of life and death: What is the difference between ketchup and catsup?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,They're gonna cut my head offff...!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, my great-great grandmother was an Indian. I guess I should've mentioned that before, huh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Simpson men get the job done!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's a tragedy, a real tragedy. I mean, what kind of tramp gets knocked up before she's even married?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I mean in this day and age, when the link between sex and pregnancy has been proven so... conclusively in... scientific American, where...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Actually... that was me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why would I go to Utah? I love booze, caffeine, and monogamy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Did she mention she was knocked up?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oops. Sorry for the spoiler.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, how 'bout that?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, one day you're going to be a great father.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, boy. Hey, for old time's sake, you wanna drive me around while I sing public domain songs out the window?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I will! I will be rich! I'll own a football team and a basketball team and I'll make them play baseball!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stop it, Winston!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The light from your eyes could guide a ship at sea.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Eh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hm... what's changed for me since the last time I saw you? Only... everything!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why do you sound so shocked? This is our fifth take.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now that I'm super-wealthy, I can buy them whatever their hearts desire. That's why rich kids turn out so well.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You see Declan, I made my millions with a simple invention -- ""The Condiment Pen""!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just click the buttons at the top and you can choose from ketchup, mustard, mayo, and relish.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I got the idea from the regular pen.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't know. You can put horseradish on your dead mother for all I care. The point is, I'm rich, rich, rich! Just look -- my dog has his own Jacuzzi!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,He loves it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, this is Eduardo, my pool boy. He thinks he's an angry rich man.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's the pool chemicals talking.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Please, Mr. Burns, pretend you work for me. You can have the boy, just don't beat him. You can beat him, just don't leave marks.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll tell you why.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's been another eight years, and what do I have? Same job, same house, same dirty joke book...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I just thought for once I could be the cool guy in your movie. But all I am is the guy who makes everyone else look good.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll pay for most of this!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, you lured me to your bay. Now what sick game are you playing?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, spirit. Are you gonna show me my future? My snow-flecked grave, mourned by no man? Well, it's not too late for me to change!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You there, boy! Buy me a Christmas goose! The biggest one in the shop!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow. I have a pretty good life after all.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Relax, Marge. I wasn't gonna kill him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All those years I was dreaming of other things, I was actually doing what I really wanted... hanging out with my family, drinking with my friends, making friends with my family, and hanging with my drinking!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you're my real dream come true. And I get to live you every day.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Relax, baby. While you were dreaming of me and calling me ""James,"" I took care of everything.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh, stumbled home at dawn, same diff. Now don't worry: I packed everyone's lunches and sent them off into the world.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look boy, nobody knows better than me that you're a lost cause. But the school's paying for five sessions and there's a Chinese restaurant next door where I can get drunk.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He's lying!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look at those dumb hillbillies! I bet they don't even know what... something is.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look at those morons -- they sing because they're stupid!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Permission to moan?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, everyone, straight ahead is my big surprise!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look out for the stairs!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, we're not going to have to worry about money ever again. Because I've got a plan...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'd like to declare bankruptcy, please!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes I do. Under chapter thirteen of the fiscal code, an individual whose debts exceed his assets may file for bankruptcy, thus protecting said assets.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What the? But I thought bankruptcy was the cool law! The one that says ""Dude, don't worry about it. I got this.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Of course, you idiot, 'cause I'm wishing for more money.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I've got three bathrooms, don't I? Next.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Give it here, I'll find some fat we can trim. Here you go, a giant useless expense for something that no one is interested in.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no. This place is too expensive. I saw you doing a ""five-hundred piece"" jigsaw puzzle in there!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, Dad, I'm cuttin' back everywhere. To save gas I'm ""Flintstone-ing"" the car.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yabba... dabba... dooooo...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why are you telling me? He's your father-in-law.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sure, but I think you're exaggerating the problem.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What are you doing here, Patty-or-Selma?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,He was a great Dad! Every year he got so mad when Santa didn't bring me presents.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, here we are, home early.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A bear is eating my father!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A talking bear is eating my father!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dad, do you know what you were kissing? Do you? Do you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well I never, ever want to see that again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, why did I borrow that roof from him?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's not right. It's like an old sea turtle dating a suitcase that fell out of a plane.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, now you're dragging hot dogs into this. Real classy, Marge. Real classy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How could my Dad go out with Selma? Don't those two gargoyles know that love is for good-looking young people?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Words hurt, you know.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid Selma and Grampa... how dare they find happiness?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh great. Who are you in love with? Bart?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, but I'm not good at details. Or the big picture. I also show up late, and drunk.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've got a good feeling about this.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Selma!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hola, I am Esteban de la Sexface. That means Stephen of the Sexface.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh baby.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dos Selmas? Ay-yi-yi!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I guess I always dreamed that my father would grow old alone.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A thousand, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nooooooo...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Lisa, that's one of those rumors you get off the internet.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Selma, want some rice?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Spooky.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So... how long is SeÃ±or Homer out of town for?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then I must flee!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where is he? Where is he? I smell his aftershave!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where is he? I know he's in here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't have to make a wish, because I already have this wonderful family. I wish for infinity hamburgers.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I get it. These are those trick candles you can't blow out.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,E-Z Blo...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This ends now!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-huh... uh-huh...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll just focus on one area... How many did I get? None? That's cool.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Or we could just resolve to be more careful with our open flames.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but uh-- One of those I dialed nine-one-one by mistake, but I was too embarrassed to admit it, so I set the house on fire. It feels good to tell the truth. No, I'm lying again, it feels bad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Aw. Our kids used to be so cute!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Used to?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, deal with it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Tick tock, sweetie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm going with the cologne I wore on our first date.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't know. Maybe the Krusty doll accidentally turned on the car's headlights, which focused on the cologne bottle, causing it to boil, and soon explode.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Captain Janeway! Your mission ended too soon! Too soon...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here I am on the space shuttle, orbiting Earth.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge! This isn't like you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Moderately wealthy?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's quite an offer -- can I discuss it with my wife?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then I'll do it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Krusty! How 'bout a nice shot of you with the boy you injured?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"How 'bout you, Gabbo?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, how 'bout an autograph for my kids?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay boy, this is that snooty supermarket all the celebrities shop at. You're gonna help me ambush them. Look at this place. Imported beer? Seedless grapes? Chewing gum?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The clown on this cereal box is just a person!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay boy, do something annoying. But leave yourself room to build.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look at those celebrities: I've met them all, and yet they don't even acknowledge my existence.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, like you care, Betty White.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Her name is Marge.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, uh... she's looking very snappy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No problem. Hey Drederick!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Your hip hop CD was boastful and unnecessary!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What are the first three?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I wanted to remember my place in the book I was reading.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, I never thought I'd have my own dark room.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, then you could come over here and help daddy pour chemicals.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Kids. They always say they're not tired when they're the most tired of all.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That photo's mine. That photo's mine. That photo's mine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"See Marge, everyone says they hate these magazines, but it's impossible to set them down.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Did I attach the harness?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,If you don't mind!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thank you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now to make a young woman's wedding day all about me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Up, up, and annoy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I also wreck bar mitzvahs!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"First Amendment rules, privacy drools!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now Maggie, I had to use your car seat to hold the new TV Guide...so I'm gonna hang you from the mirror.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"He's trying to make me look like a bad father. Maggie, take the wheel!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ten and two, Einstein!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can't I even have privacy here?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How could you publish this? I thought we were friends!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And then he said he didn't want a twin because they'd just fight.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're right -- I'm giving up photography...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And my own medicine!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So long, anti-clotting agent!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Clot-clot-clot-clot-clot!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Listen to 'em. They're on top of the world while I'm sittin' here pretending I have a stool.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All because of a bunch of stuff that happened.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You guys are right -- I should get back in the game. But I threw away my camera.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, Moe!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How do you want your comeuppance: eight by ten or wallet size?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nothing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Providing you celebrities do something for me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I want you all to show some respect for the people who made you what you are. Sign an autograph or two... support a charity for something that hasn't happened to a member of your family... let one of us regular guys write a terrible children's book!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, Papa John's.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's wrong?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Marge, you gotta get on the net. It's got all the best conspiracy theories. Did you know that Hezbollah owns Little Dolly Snack Cakes? This stuff will rock your world.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Never!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why don't I just put on a dress?!,,,,,

Homer Simpson,Foul on twenty-three!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I said foul on twenty-three!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well I'm throwing you both out of the game!,,,,,

Homer Simpson,A common problem. Try this.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sex problem, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Relax. I'm a licensed mattress professional, if there were such a thing. And I've got the answer to your problems -- the Snugulux, by Matrimonium!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And remember: your most intimate secrets are safe with me. Okay, who else is dead in bed?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The Lovejoys?! If this is about me drinking that holy water, let me tell you I had had like a million Doritos -- you know, the ones with the flame on the bag? Oh-ho, that bag ain't lyin'!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's wrong with it?,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"It was made for Elvis, but he found it tacky.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't believe a mattress could make that much difference...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lousy Reverend. He's having my sex! While I'm at home with Marge not doing anything sexual or erotic.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Okay Nappien, do your stuff.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's not working! You lousy, worthless piece of--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What a wonderful night's sleep. Thank you methasorbizone tartrate, also known as Nappien.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's ridiculous. If I had set up those dominoes, I'd be wearing my special domino-setting up kneepads.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How is that possible?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mood swings?! Mood swings. Mood swings!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mood swings? Mood swings! Mood swings! Mood swings! Mood swings! Mood swings, mood swings! Mood swings!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nappien, you did it again! And everything is as it should be.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,John Lennon?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yoko?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well son, your Uncle Homer is, like eighty percent of America, whacked-out on prescription drugs.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're confusing drugs with druuuuugs.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, here's the solution -- I want you kids to lock the bedroom from the outside, so I can't get out and perpetrate my nocturnal mischief.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"What are you, a travel agent? 'Cause you're sending me on a guilt trip.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I feel kinda responsible. Maybe I should volunteer to be a fireman.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I can't wait for my first fire. Is that one?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is that one?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't! That fire siren could sound at any moment.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Not me, they love me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Die, you stupid cobra, die!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A lady motorcycle driver?! What is this, the Twilight Zone?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So did you see the show tonight? Remember the part where I forgot the words and I just sang ""Uh-oh Spaghetti-os"". I'm hoping they send me a case.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um, everyone's wearing clothes in here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, I'm not sure she's workin' out.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's it! Let me make something very clear: my heart belongs to Marge and you can never, ever have it. This opera's over when the fat man sings.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's good. You've calmly accepted that you will never have the only man you could ever love. Now, I think it would be best if you left.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Julia, wait!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Before you go, could you hire your own replacement? But make sure she's not crazy like you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Who could it be? A disgruntled former employee? Whoever it is, the cobra is their symbol.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH / WOO WOO WOO WOO WOO WOO HOO / STU STU STU STU-PID FLANDERS...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"GET LOST, YOU WASTE OF A MOUSTACHE!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well that's it, I'm retiring from the opera. It's just too popular.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I know something much more fun I can do on my back.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Singing opera made me good at painting.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,YOU KNOW YOU MAKE ME WANNA,,,,,
Homer Simpson,THROW MY HANDS UP AND,,,,,
Homer Simpson,KICK MY HEELS UP AND,,,,,
Homer Simpson,HEY-EY-EY-EY-EY!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A LITTLE BIT LOUDER NOW!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,HEY-EY-EY-EY-EY!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No problem.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"My, you've grown.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Spilled milk?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All over the floor.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Apu, what happened to all your milk?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Does it work?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Moe, got any milk?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's paint. Or is it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, it's paint.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've gotta find milk somewhere!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,At first I thought you were pointing to your crotch.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's my car!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, please, give me a break. I've been driving all night looking for milk for my kids.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay. Let me just grab my registration.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't believe your boss lets you listen to rock music while you work.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, I'd really like to meet this guy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But it's just you and me... That must mean I'm your boss. I'm sick of you! You're fired!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Shut up! When you call in sick, who do you call?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sometimes you want to work?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Street cattle?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think it goes here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Some of those were pretty funny.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, you make people miserable and there's nothing they can do about it. Just like God.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man oh man, you've got the greatest job in the world!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I would love to! But I don't have a tow truck.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm not sure my wife will go for these naughty mud flaps.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, that's still too sexy for my wife.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man, you work as a silhouette model for one day and it haunts you for the rest of your life.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...which I previously alluded... Are there two ""l's"" in ""alluded""?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why? What happens if I point it this way?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, my first tow.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, my first tow.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really? What's your handicap?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm doing my job!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're hovering over a hydrant!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I've got tow dough I'm lookin' to blow, Moe!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm buying a round of the fanciest drink you got.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Outside? That's a one-hour parking zone -- and you've been here a good eighty-one minutes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, when you're married to a midnight towboy, you might not see him for days on end.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, when you married a man who would, years later, without warning, become a tow truck driver, you knew what the deal would eventually be.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Guess what, boy. Last night I towed your principal's car.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's Homer, idiot.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I guess I'm more powerful than God now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who said that? I'll kill them with my power!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my God... multiple tickets... handicapped spot... parked by a hydrant... incomprehensible vanity plate...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If my life as a tow truck driver were a teleplay, this would be the end of act two.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What? I'm still in Springfield.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, I made a mistake. Why don't you give me two demerit points in a point system we work out right now?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Put me down, you lousy-- Wheeee! Okay, I'm warning you-- Wheeee! I'll kill you, you son of a-- Wheeee! All right buddy, that's it, I've had-- Whee--!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You... let... go...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, a trap door. What's down there? Your meatball collection?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I thought we were friends! I was kidding you in a friendly fashion!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who are you guys?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is Louie keeping you prisoner here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, I get it. I'm not stupid. It's number two, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do not worry. I am working.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ask no questions. And do not call the police, or I will kill me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,All is well. Goodbye forever.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And all the Transformers transformed back into trucks and cars. The end.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, we've got time for one more.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Once upon a time, there was a hilarious ogre named Shrek Three. He lived in medieval times, but sometimes he'd say things from today times...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And if elected president of our small community, I will determine once and for all how far we can go without being gay.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maggie!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We're free!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maggie! You did all this?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And to pay you back, I'm returning your nose.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Here's your nose. Daddy's putting back your nose.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, wait. That's Lisa's nose.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thanks to her!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, Bart! Lookin' good!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Right... tomorrow.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Think. Think.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You have to think, it's your job!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?! Name twelve.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,American sober or Irish sober?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Point one five.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Point one oh with a stomach full of bread. My final offer.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Goodnight, sweetheart.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can't be late for Lisa's big day...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm gonna make it! I'll be on time for Lisa's thing!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooo, an awesome accident! Easy, easy... I'll just take three seconds to gawk. Aw, everyone's okay.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gonna make it! Gonna make it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmmm. Well, Marge, who's the unfit parent now?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"An hour and fifty-four minutes to spare. With my free time I can finally work on my ""Superman"" novel.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Make way for Superman,"" said Superman as he punched everyone at the Coffee Bean. Chapter Two...""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, hello, Marge. I'm at the most important event of our daughter's life, and you're totally late. Am I disappointed? Yes. Am I surprised? No.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What?! Oh my God, my sweet Margie! Okay, listen very carefully: don't do anything they say, remain panicky, and above all, try to be a hero.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Chief, you gotta do something -- my current wife is in there!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Marge, I was afraid I was going to lose you! Ohhh! Now let me help you make your slow transition back to society.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You have a new home now... with us.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sweetheart, what's wrong?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You don't owe him anything. Moe was in the hospital for three weeks and I didn't visit him once.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe the tavern, not Moe the person.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Marge, look at us -- the four amigos! They're gonna let me do some odd jobs for them on the outside.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The problem is, you don't share my interest in not being with you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why does he always bring up my weight?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, sir. I'll handle this cleanly, quietly and Bart!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm gonna be home late tonight. I'm going to... Midnight Monkey Madness at the zoo.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Have fun at your crazy-sounding thing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now all I have to do is think of a clever line before I pull the trigger. Oh, that's a perfect one. But I don't need to say it out loud, 'cause I'm by myself.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Out of my way, mystery skank!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey! Now I don't get paid!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now I'm mad!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now I'm .,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge is a professional assassin!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's that?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Great, great -- I turned over so many wheelbarrows... Wait, that was your thing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Seconds, please.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll kill her after dessert!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You ruined that pie!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How could you not tell me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, they're not as pretty as you, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, here's the deal, I'll do the killing for hire, and you stay home with the kids.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I just get to keep whatever's in the guy's wallet.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I was out getting drunk, then killing people!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why do you think I'm kicking it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, who wants ice cream in bed?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,At your funeral.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that was so hot! I love watching you do other guys!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That can be arranged.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...so, killing people together has really spiced things up in the bedroom.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,CrÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e! CrÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e! Or in English: Burnt Cream! Burnt Cream!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Ma-arge! Want some com-pany? As always, silence means yes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"How about a little neck rub, baby?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, how 'bout the neck of my butt...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Marge, your tentacles feel so good. Wait a minute... why am I getting words in edgewise?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, son -- I've got a plan to save your space doggy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who is it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'm not decent. Let me throw something on!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Can I help you, gentlemen?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, you guys are good. The alien's right here in the living room.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hop in, Bart, they're gonna let us kill one!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Homer -- bored!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Quiet -- we're missing the dissection!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No one likes a know-it-all.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, lighten up. It's Halloween -- a night for mischief and merriment.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hold still! I'm trying to eat my way out from the inside!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,More bread please.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hm, I thought I was killed by that magic spaghetti!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay Maggie, just calmly and carefully back away.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Beehive!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Blueberries!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Way to go! Many happy returns.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,There are so many choices. Bolo? Clip on? Piano keys? Ten Commandments of Beer?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The cornerstones of the Brewish faith.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And what color would that be?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Of course I know!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Is ""beautiful"" a color?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, give me a break! I don't notice the color of people's eyes! I just judge them on the color of their skin.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,She's wearing white? She must have rolled the odometer back to zero.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Spaz.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...that's why, to this day, you never see a shark with monkey arms.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Because if I do it enough, maybe they'll start to pay me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sleep tight. The Container Store now has five convenient locations!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, boy. They'll find your parents soon.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And we'll move your bedtime to an hour later so you'll have more time to be alone with your thoughts.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey come on, why don't you cheer up with a glass of Ocean Spray? Oh boy -- forget that. How about some... Cap'n Crunch? Uh, Seven Seas Italian dressing? No, no! Uh, Chicken of the Sea tuna? Billy Ocean CD? The history of Atlantic Records?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I want to, but I can't!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good idea. I'll drown my sorrows in Anchor Steam Beer! Oh, I'm sorry!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where is it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I gotta find out what color Marge's eyes are.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cha-ching!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Marge darling, what's the combination to our wedding album?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, stop talking to yourself!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Your thoughts should stay in your head! Heh, heh, I sure told him. Now, what am I gonna do about Marge?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'll never remember what color Marge's eyes are!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Brown? No. Orange? No. Elm? Rake? Guessing?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A song? Wait, it's coming back to me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,THE GIRL I LOVE'S GOT BEAUTIFUL HAIR / A BLUE BOUFFANT FROM HERE TO THERE,,,,,
Homer Simpson,SNOW WHITE TEETH AND LIPS SO RED / SHE'S THE WILMA TO MY FRED,,,,,
Homer Simpson,OH THE GIRL I LOVE'S GOT BEAUTIFUL... EYES,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"/ WHEN HAPPY THEY SPARKLE, WHEN SAD THEY CRIES",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"/ THOSE EYES ARE GEMS BEYOND APPRAISAL / STUNNING SHADE OF PUREST... Oh, what is it?! I was so close! Let's see, what rhymes with appraisal: basil, nasal -- none of these are colors! Oh, it's hopeless! She'll never love me again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hazel! Your eyes are hazel -- hazel like the pussywillows by the pond where we first kissed, like the almond paste in the bear claw I ate after we first made love.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmm... porkpie.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I wish you well, but why would women want to go to a gym if there were no men there watching them and judging them?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We're gonna be rich! We can finally start a family!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A better one!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah, Marge, I love these business trips of yours. The TV remote isn't nailed on. My whole life, I've never been in a hotel that trusted me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hors d'oeuvres, big fancy desserts... and my wife is paying for everything. Now I know why pimps are so happy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I hear that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fine, I admit it. I'm drunk!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, how ya doin'? I'm Homer. My wife invented a gym for ""regular"" women.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I pay ten dollars a tube for those!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, I haven't decided what kind of new car to get.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you sure they're not talking about cars? Because those are car words.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge won't dump me. I'm the anchor that keeps her weighed down.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That will never happen!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge! Marge!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A makeover!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my God! The prophecy is being fulfilled.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um, so... tell me about your day.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I do! I do!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, the networks have different channels in this city.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you happy and full of life?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Old one?! They're convincing Marge to dump me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, get away from them!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You guys gotta help me! If Marge leaves I'll have nothing except my many friends, and half the fortune she is now making and will continue to make.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's your secret?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-huh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fashions.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh-huh, uh-huh... got it. I know just what it'll take to hang onto Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Please, Doc. I know I'm not the greatest looking guy in the world, but I took care of my family, and that used to be enough. But not anymore.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I know how I can knock myself out. I'll look at your bill.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hm. I guess considering all the training you've received, this is quite reasonable. I've never seen anything so reasonable! It's the bargain of a lifetime! And--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kids, your daddy underwent a special procedure so he can be more attractive to your mother.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I had my stomach stapled!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,All food tastes like barf now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Welcome home, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A smart successful woman like you deserves the very best.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do you like guys who are... attractive?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All for you, baby.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whoa, whoa, whoa -- slow down, sexy beast. Why don't you take some time to savor the front?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, it used to be.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, I'm gonna turn off the lights now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Doctor, I'm embarrassed to show my body to my wife. And it's all because of your surgery!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I want you to give me every other surgery you have so I can look good! And can you call it an aortic valve replacement so my insurance will cover it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Did someone order a super stud?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My implants feel itchy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You better not make me cry. 'Cause I don't know where my tear ducts are anymore.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't want to live without you, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Noooo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh? Why do I look like me again?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then it was all a dream. I never became a hideous monster.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I sure have. Plastic surgery is a mistake -- because it hasn't been perfected to where you look really good. When it is, everyone should get it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen Marge... I've been wondering all these years, what is it about me that you find so irresistible? Let's face it... you could do better.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Aw...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now ignore all the fancy-shmancy thingamajigs, boy. We're just gonna get a camera battery and go home.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No thanks -- just here for a battery.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All I want is a battery.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Battery, battery, battery!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmm...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bingo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"One battery, please.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sold! Sucker.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My what now?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, Lisa! The TV's been off for five whole minutes!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I spit on your corpse, advertiser-supported television!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why is everything Hollywood makes so excellent? Whyyyy?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sometimes I think about gettin' on a bus and never comin' back.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good luck, with my finicky appetite.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sold!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,THAT'S HOW THEY GETCHA!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,More ribs for me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,More ribs for me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,More ribs for me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Finally, some service. Now listen. We wanna sit under a cool state license plate -- Michigan or better.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Next time a commercial comes on, I'm gonna close my eyes, cover my ears and scream as loud as I can.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'd like to know if Wes Doobner is aware of what you're doing in his restaurant.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Doobner, I have a complaint: I work hard, and when I go out with my family, I expect a certain level of basic--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nobody do it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Finally, the ribs.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yet another new restaurant fails.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He cheats at Uno!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, well, between you and me, I still can't stand him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I still can't stand him... I still can't stand him... I still can't stand him...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't care about these church jerks... church jerks... church jerks...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I'm getting a home perm!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-huh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A doctor, huh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I remember.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-huh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you done? 'Cause I've been circling the funeral home for ten minutes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what smells so good?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Eat hobo remains!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, he's got to get over his fear of coffins.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah. The only thing that's gonna be hacked to pieces now is this celebratory cake!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, I must have really tied one on last night.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No more drinking.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Six a.m. -- still early enough to sneak into bed and pretend I actually got home at three a.m.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where's Marge?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, kids! Have you seen your mother?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Or yourselves?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Maggie? Has anyone seen anyone?! Oh, of course, they must all be taking a family bath. Without me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Save some suds for--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Daddy...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey boy! Do you know where the family is? Show me on Mapquest.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine. Google Maps.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What's going on, why are you attacking me? Look, if this is about me eating your heart pills, they shouldn't have made them in Good 'N' Plenty colors!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe, my family's gone, my dog hates me, and I can't remember what happened last night. Was I here?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A ""Forget-Me-Shot?"" Never heard of it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mmm, pickle...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my God, why would I wanna wipe out my memory? What horrible thing did I do?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Chief Wiggum! I remember seeing you...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge had a black eye?! I could never do something like that! Could I?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Flanders!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The queen's private surgeonnn!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What did I do?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What happened in this room? If only these walls could talk... people would pay to come see my amazing talking walls. And I could use that money to-- Hey, a memory!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dad, I can't remember what I did last night. Do you have any idea?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Your memory bubble and you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm afraid I did something to make Marge and the kids leave me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Really? Well, that's great, Dad. How can I ever repay you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Done.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How 'bout The Deja Viewmaster?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Remembrance of things fast?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The Rememberererer?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This is great! I'm finally gonna find out how I ruined my family! Strap me in, nerd!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bo-ring.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ow. Ow. Ow!!! Three, two, one. Owwwww!!!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the hell?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This bubble allows you to view any past event from your life. It's got that new bubble smell.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, I landed in a pleasant memory -- look at happy me and playful them.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I miss those bygone days of earlier this week. But I'm needed in a darker place.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Another man... with my wife... in my house... on top of my TV Guide?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I've gotta find out who that guy is, but I need help. Someone like Bart, only smart. Lisa!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, I'm about to probe the most shattering moment of my life. You wanna join me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bring it on.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, let's see how you do against twenty-year-old Homer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll teach you to beat up yester-me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who was it with?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Right.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kids, your mom is with another man, and I need you to help me find out who he is. Hm... is this really something I should show you kids?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's okay -- we're not really your kids. We're just representations of them, that you created in your mind.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really? Then if I created all this... that means I can have pizza anytime I want!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, I'd like to order a pizza. Thirty-five minutes?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,See? That's where my memory stops. Who the heck is that guy?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What if you just moved the bottle?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right. Let me just get out of this bubble smoothly and elegantly.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How can I get my memory to work?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The mother of my children with the reason for my children!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Noooo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Your stupid invention made me realize my life is worthless!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My life is ruined.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Goodbye, cruel world.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And goodbye, Cruller World.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute -- if killing myself would make you two happy, then I'm not gonna do it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My life's flashing before my eyes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A life well-lived. Until last night. I guess I'll have to watch that now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's going on here?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A surprise party?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you kidding? The mother of my children with the reason for my children! This is gonna be the greatest party ever!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my God! It's like Christmas in December! Let's celebrate now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry honey, I'll get you an ice pack. Where's the ice pack?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So Marge wasn't cheating on me, I never hit her, and my family is throwing me an awesome party. Thank God I figured it out before I did anything stupid.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my God! I'm not dead!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is great! I must be the first gullible husband to overhear snippets of surprise party planning and think it was my wife having an affair.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What plan?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge put so much work into that party. The least I could do is be surprised. If only I could forget what happened today.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmmm... The only problem is, I'm sure to retain some image of coming home and finding Duffman. No doubt I'll misconstrue that as him placing a cuckold's horns upon my brow. And that will make me want to jump off a--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"For the love of God, make sure the party boat has a moon-bounce.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And when you pushed me off the bridge, it's 'cause you knew about the party and wanted to make sure I got here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmmm... The only thing that still doesn't make sense is why the dog attacked me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who's an angry dog? Who's an angry dog?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, this is a moment I want to remember.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh no! He's talking to that mailroom guy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen carefully. I have taken your wife hostage. If you don't have a wife, I have kidnapped your brother. Nod if you understand.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, back away from Burns and I will let your dog live.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Good. Now stop and dance like a happy prospector.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Happier!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Happier!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Happier!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh right. Just leave! But kick like a Rockette!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We're free!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Set the table, Marge!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can already taste those deep-fried pork chops!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,When you ask me that it's never good.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, that was a joke!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, if I'm gonna start a diet, this is my last chance to eat all the crap I love.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I think I'll miss you most of all, Captain Corndog's Schnitzel Palace. No tears, Homer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh-oh, can't let Marge see this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A drive-up trashcan!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This must be how the rich toss out their gold. And as long as I'm cleaning out the family chariot...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cups... newspapers... bottles... tricycle... lawn chair... un-cashed checks...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmm... ""Dispose of proper--"" This book is too hard.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now for a victory cigar.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't stand to see a grown burger cry. We must rebuild Fast Food Boulevard!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't know about you, but I don't want to live in a future where food is brought by waiters... where the chairs aren't attached to the tables... and where I can't ditch my kids in a pit of dirty balls. I say we rebuild the Fast-Food District -- bigger and better than ever!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, Marge, it's primary fever -- catch it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Think tank, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What? Not allowed to get one right?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Die Hard Two!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I live in that place!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He's got my vote.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dear God. What have I done?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my God, they're going steady -- did everyone see that?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That was the best milkshake ad I've ever seen. It makes me want a milkshake!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If you haven't sprung from, or aren't married to my loins, get the hell out of this house!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You too, Fred Thompson.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is everyone here as sick of those stupid politicians as I am?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why don't we all pick the most ridiculous candidate, and write him in?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no. This candidate has to be unbelievably ridiculous.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No. But you're close.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What I did made the TV thing happen.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I dig the Wig! I dig the Wig!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, being President is easy. You just point the army and shoot.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, the Patriot Act is so terrible! The government might find out what library books I take out. What's next -- finding out what operas I go to?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, kids. These wool socks and down parkas will keep you warm.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I thought global warming would take care of it. Al Gore can't do anything right.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Like which kid's their favorite! It's Lisa.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Things happened between your mother and me that we're not proud of. It was the middle of a wild decade known as the nineteen nineties.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it was a wonderful time. The Iraq war was over once and for all, a struggling Matt Groening created ""Futurama,"" and young people believed in their dreams, thanks to a TV show called ""Melrose Place""...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Your mother and I were dating and we had just moved into our first apartment together.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We didn't have a lot of money, but we were young and in love.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Like all young people, I had a musical dream.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A dream called inoffensive urban light hip-hop smooth grooves.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But Marge's education was worth all the pistol whipping in the world.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge! Marge! Where are you?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I was so depressed, I spent all my time in a bar.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I had finally realized every rock star's dream...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,...hating being famous.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A tale of two young outlaws in love...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I had become diabetic from drinking too many Frappuccinos.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"With the nineties drawing to a close, and the Sydney Olympics to look forward to, our love rekindled...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And one moonlit night, I finally had fun at a mini-golf course.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yep, that professor couldn't keep me and Marge apart.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I mean, unless he had been a little nicer at the beach.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And once we were back together, I was too happy ever to grunge again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good, 'cause I'm parking at it right now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"For the next two hours, we'll be kid free. It'll be just like the time we lost them at the mall.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That was the best Christmas ever.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, the Tunnel of Love -- nothing gets a woman in your arms faster than scary robots and simulated privacy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge! Look over there!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What if I told you some of the greatest love stories of all time?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Even better -- a tale of ... One moment.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You'd think so, but...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They were the Bonnie and Clyde of their day. Their names were... Bonnie and Clyde.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Even love is boring when you're stuck in a tunnel of it. Why can't this be the Tunnel of Hockey Fights?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Happy Valentine's Day, and shut your gob.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Loa...ner?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow. This is the kind of car you see in commercials! How much am I paying for this?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hm, it seems like a lot...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Really? You people are idiots! That's the dumb-- What a stu-- I mean, that sounds fair.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look at you! Idiots!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,DRIVER OF A LOANER CAR / MUCH BETTER THAN A / DRIVER OF MY NORMAL CAR...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,None.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey boy, check out my new car!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wanna take a ride with your old man?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,C'mon. C'mon. Oh c'mon.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What's the matter, son?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, don't give up, boy. I believe in you -- and not just because I have to.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, I know when we first met, we didn't really hit it off. But since then, I've really come to respect you. And unlike love, respect can't be bought.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's my boy! Now let's watch the air conditioner fight the heater!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now let's add the rear window defogger!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Twister! Get down!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mrs. Simpson, may I take you for an evening drive? Our loaner awaits!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-huh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, you've reached the snug bug. What do you mean my car's ready?! Well you can keep it, 'cause I'm never giving up this one. Now why don't you enjoy the sounds of my wife and me making sweet, sweet love.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That wasn't us, that was the transmission.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, I can't believe all those years I used to drive that old piece of... What the?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My old car!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So you're sure this baby'll make it out to the desert?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sure! Why, what did ya have in mind?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, we're gonna start by shootin' her full of holes. And then me and the boys are gonna have a little fun with her.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll have you know I love this car as if it was my own child.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Maggie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's too much work. Why don't you come and get me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just gimme a minute. But feel free to go nuts on me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh boy, dinner time! The perfect break between work and drunk.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait, what's that smell? It's like a stalk of broccoli fell in a pot of boiling water.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I have all those old diets I still haven't finished.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll bet no man would touch you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's tangy like a pepper, but crunchy like a bell!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Three please!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not quite.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, they say muscle weighs more than fat.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?! I'm not even gonna dignify that with eye contact.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Marge, looking for something? I'm looking for something too -- a bell pepper I don't like. Maybe it'll be this one.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wrong again.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Work.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I, uh, I have to count the atoms at the nuclear plant. Conservation of mass -- it's the law.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I now declare you chips and salsa.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, hey, kids! Um... What's up?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well... I certainly wasn't eating chips and salsa from this briefcase.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nothing!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mmm, lamb.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, pick up, pick up! I know you're there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen, baby. The other night was great, but it can never happen again. Oh, who am I kidding? I have to see you right now!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pudding power activate!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sweetheart, I didn't want to deceive you. I just couldn't stand to see the disappointment in your beautiful eyes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, it's me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm Lord Evilton from the ""Angelica Button"" books.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, boy. All the nerds are doin' it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Move or die!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, that's our book for the year -- I think we've earned some TV.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But kids, I want you in bed by three a.m.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, somebody's gotta be the bad guy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stop saying things, Bart! That's the TV's job!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's right. Now I'll cut and you soak.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Go-go or boring?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, while your mother and little mother are out, I'm gonna let you in on a deep dark family secret.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I said secret.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Have you ever wondered what I do in that locked room?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well wonder no more!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Some of that is cow blood.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"My Hindu friend, this is a chance for your Kwik-E-Mart to get in on the ground floor of a delicious new taste sensation.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where's our jerky?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait, wait, wait, wait! You haven't seen our Power Point presentation. Bart?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who could have done this?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This can only mean one thing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Flanders! You ate my jerky!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I know you ate my jerky. Just like I ate your earthquake supplies!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You stay right here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, that's it, don't be shy...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Enjoy your jerky laced with sleeping pills... nobody outwits Homer Simpson... Hey, they're not sleepy. They're just turning fuzzy...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I thought this might happen, so I brought the best weapon to operate while drugged: a crossbow.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That wasn't a defeat, it was a phased withdrawal.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're on your own.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,When you cut 'em they multiply -- I can't fight that! Now let's take care of those raccoons.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Awww, they're using the jerky to feed their family! Look, there's a Homer and a Bart and a Marge and a Lisa. Aww... and they even share my views on parenting!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Enjoy your jerky, little critters, and one day you'll grow up to be people. Bart, get some more jerky for man's new best friend.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lisa!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gimme that!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't believe how easy it is in this country to get cigarettes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't believe you were smoking. Do you know the sturgeon general said you're not supposed to?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And a very wise fish he is!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm taking Lisa out of that stupid-- What the?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... are you sure you want Lisa to keep dancing?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maybe you're drunk.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fatherhood hurts my brain.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Because it means so much to your mother, you can keep doing ballet. But you have to stop smoking -- including secondhand!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What'd you say?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I thought you might have trouble with this. That's why I'm assigning someone to keep watch over you. Someone you'd never expect.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on out, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Y'ello. She what?! Oh, my God! Well I'm gonna settle this once and for all! Meet me at the place we discussed.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wrong number.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, Bart, it's time for operation: crazy-plan. Step one: we chuck the raccoon in there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't worry. I have a perfect way to conceal his identity.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"See? Now go, boy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not keys, cigarettes!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, that's what I mean.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hee-hee. Okay, now we get rid of the cigarettes...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is my favorite family tradition -- ice cream after a botched recital.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now practice preening to the crowd, El Guapo.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, preen harder! Make them hate you! You feed on their hatred... and you are so hungry!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dad, are you sure you're okay to drive at night?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, that's it, pull over.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I was having the most wonderful dream. I always wake up just before the good part.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll see you later, honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Homer Simpson. I know a lot of you from church, and the market and such. And I'm not much for talkin' -- but seems to me, in hard times like these that we Americans come together.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So I say we roll up our sleeves, and fake a disaster to trick the federal government out of relief money.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kids, marriage is like a car. Along the way it has its bumps and dings, and this country can't make one that lasts more than five years. With Lurleen I just walked past the showroom and didn't even go inside. Now let's return to watching the news.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I told her not to go into one of those.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, you can stay with us. I'm sure Marge will be cool.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Confederate degenerate?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, you sure have married a lot of super-hunks.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"How could a man just abandon his family? By which I mean, what is the method he would use and could anyone do it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where you going?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute -- he's a deadbeat dad, and yet he's getting as much love as me, a Dad too lazy to run away!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And he has hair! Bart, get me my suicide axe.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Later.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just sit still in my lap!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get back here so we can put our love on a shirt!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lurleen's daddy comes back after thirty years and he's father of the year. Why can't I leave for thirty years?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well... it might be cold outside.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I see. It's reverse psychology. Well in that case I'm not going and I'm not staying. And I'll cut my steak with a spoon, then take a walk on the ceiling.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Song's over, Dad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, me too. Since her father re-abandoned her, she's cut the word ""pop"" out of all of our foods.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, my fringes are knotted again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And remember, you can do anything you want in the world of country music, western wear merchandising and TV movies. Regular movies, don't hold your breath. But TV movies, the sky's the limit.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ten percent Lycra.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooo, I think he's a keeper.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's right.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't you worry about Wikipedia -- we'll change it when we get home. We'll change a lot of things.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, what's the deal, loser?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, a lot of these youth organizations encourage parents to get involved in the activities--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sold.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,See ya!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, let this be a lesson: never work hard and don't form emotional attachments. Also, don't be a cow.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I'll make sure Flanders doesn't bother us.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart's in trouble and we don't need your stupid comments!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, they bought it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Have you got Lou in your car?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You guys come and get me as soon as they dump me back in the feedlot.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, Laughter House! With the world in the shape it's in, we could all use some comedy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ready... for... pick up. Ready! For! Pick up!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm a human being -- let me go!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmm... that sounds like Tress MacNeille.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge... kids... the things I saw. It makes me never wanna eat meat again...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just fish... chicken... burgers... veal on Fridays... deer, but only in season... and if necessary, the sweetest meat of all... human.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We're not here for the game. The game is nothing. The game is crap. The game makes me sick!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The real reason we Americans put up with sports, is for this...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Behold, the tailgate party -- the pinnacle of human achievement!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Since the dawn of parking lots, man has sought to stuff his guts with food and alcohol in anticipation of watching others exercise. What childbirth is to women, eating trunk meats is to the be-wanged.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What could be greater than eating and drinking for hours in a drizzly parking lot?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, time to dig in. I brought everything we need.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The food is all around us.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Up-bup-bup-bup-bup... when you know the people you're begging from, it's mooching.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moleman! Come here, ya big bag-a skin! How the hell are ya, huh?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah? No kidding? Well, that sounds like you're gonna have fun.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can I be Smithers?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why, 'cause I'm fat?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What, I'm going for a Shia LaBeouf thing. Not quite a nerd, not quite a hunk... Shia LaBeouf!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh. There's already an on-set romance.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stupid charities, they think I'm gonna give them money? Save the Children? Save your breath. Take a hike, Sierra Club! Doctors Without Borders? Doctors without money! Hey, Greenpeace, you're not getting' a piece of my green! Robert Redford? Guess what -- a scissor runs through it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Film Festival,"" eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where'd everybody go?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Maybe I can finally meet Jim Jarmusch and ask him who he is. Hey, that's him!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who are you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What else?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Prove it, Hollywood!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you're crying!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We can't wait to see it, sweetie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A documentary?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"One, two, three... Another chute?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why... doesn't... life... give me... ladders?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You stupid kid! What if I walked in here barefoot?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Quirky? Quirky is a grandma who gives people the finger! You made us look like monsters!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't you dare post that review.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not if I can help it! C'mere, beams! Come on! Hey, hey, where you going? Oh, there's too many!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I never wanted to be famous for being mean. I wanted to be famous for catching Santa Claus.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I know! Kinda miss it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sit on a bench! Sit on a bench!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, this is kind of a cute outfit.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What did you say?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's a medical condition!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who told you these things about me?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't want to get mad, but I will!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's it...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It didn't have to go down like this!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry -- I'm ready for this. Bart, fetch ""The Defender.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's where the food sleeps!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute, I smell apples... cinnamon... crust... it's a pie!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why would a robber make pie?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're right, boy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mom!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're alive! And you baked a pie!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm fighting the robber -- you go get ice cream!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mom, I can't believe you're here. You keep disappearing and reappearing and it's not funny. You're just like that show ""Scrubs"".",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No thanks.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Every time you go, I feel abandoned. But not this time. I'm not gonna let myself get hurt.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's what your mouth says, but my ears are too smart to believe it. In fact, I don't even want your pie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well I'm not going to digest it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You left a hole in my heart that could never be filled. So I filled it with food. But I'm never full.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I don't even care.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm fine -- it's my feelings that are mad.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No! I can't forgive you -- and I don't accept your tuck-in!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I feel terrible. My own mother reached out to me, and I rejected her. I'm gonna make her a card.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mom?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you asleep?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Asleep with your eyes open? Mom?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mom!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My mother's dead.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, this just gets worse and worse.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll tell you what she didn't want -- me to be a jerk to her and then she dies.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,She said I didn't suck?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That bad. Wow.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I just wish she hadn't died thinking I hated her.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Apu, what do you think happens after you die?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I mean, do you think my mother's out there somewhere? Does she know I feel bad about things I said?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A donut from the future!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, ma. You always knew just how to make everything all right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It works on so many levels.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've gotta get out of here!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, this is it. I've got one last chance to make up for the things I said to my Mom. I will avenge you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm really glad you corrected me, Lisa. People are always really glad when they're corrected.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This is hard work. Isn't it, boy? Boy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I always knew that at the end, it would all come down to me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"To spare, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, your back is so sweaty. I'm starting to slip off.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's the highest point. And only fifteen minutes to go.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Made it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mom, we didn't know each other very well. If we did, you never would have asked me to climb anything. But even when you weren't around, I always felt good, knowing you were out there somewhere.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Three o'clock. Goodbye, Mom. You're finally free.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute... Mom's ashes stopped that missile launch. Mom! You used me to pull one more stupid hippie protest, didn't you!?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hm, what could I make from those two things?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm safe as long as nothing disturbs this incredibly delicate balance.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wheee!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Show me the law that says I can't! Wheee!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't think so.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You can have her. To me, she's been nothing but trouble.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just what are you guys up to?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The rainforest?! That's that thing Lisa likes!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You monster! On another subject, next Thursday I have to leave work early. I assume that's cool.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mom, I'm so sorry. You just wanted to stop one more senseless act of madness in the world. Well, if I get out of this I promise you I'll grant your last wish.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Toss it down!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How am I ever gonna take on all those guys?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,God Bless America!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That'll do, brick, that'll do.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now I'll just add water to these ashes and bring my mother back to life.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well then, Mom, this was for you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pee?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart's having girl trouble. You better go talk to him.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I thought I was in charge of bedtime stories and pets dying.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fine -- but you just bought yourself ""ear piercing"" and ""strange new feelings.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, the healthy thing is to get rid of everything that reminds you of Krusty...which appears to be everything. Hey, maybe we should give Lisa this room. You know she works for Krusty now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, we'll stick with the coins.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son... all hobbies suck. But if you keep at it, you might find at the end that you've managed to kill some precious time.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do you wanna collect coins with your old man?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,To your mother's purse!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is the first book I've ever finished reading or pushing things into.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We missed one!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The one on the left looks into it, but the one on the right is just experimenting. Son, we are getting that coin!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is a classic nineteen seventy-eight Pizza Hut! Mmm... terrible.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, coin collecting's a lot like life. It stopped being fun a long time ago. But unlike life, I have a solution for this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay boy, this is it. Five dollars!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Five dollars cash!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Five hundred and one!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Objection, your honor.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Burns, my son and I have been collecting coins. It's really brought us closer together. That penny you bought tonight would mean the world to him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah. I'll tell you what, at least help me buy the boy a gumball. Do you have change for a nickel?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Aaaaannnnnd done.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You got it, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll use my one phone call to find out all about it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Three-peat.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I make that in a year.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And if I don't show up?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What a great job. And I could use a job right now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, I've set my trap. Now to scatter my cheese cubes and the rats will come. Condos! Affordable condos! Bail-jumpers welcome!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stop -- in the name of a private citizen with no connection to the law!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, are you gonna come quietly, or do I have to...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, let's think about this. If you shoot me, I won't be able to stop you and you'll be free to go. But someone may come after you. Probably not, given your reputation for shooting people who come after you. What I'm trying to say is, not shooting me now would be the biggest mistake of your life.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Flanders!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This case is ""in the bag.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I sure could've, thanks to you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Ned.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I brought you something.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He hands a greeting card to Ned.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,ANGLE ON: GREETING CARD,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's your share of the money for bringing in that bail jumper.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ned, I never thought I'd say this, but we make a great team.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We should be bounty hunters together. You're kind and smart, I'm cruel and strong. Together, we're nothing. But together, we're the perfect bounty hunter.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sure. What is it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And you have to promise no diddilies or doodilies.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This taser is awesome. Finally, a practical use for electricity.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just warming it up. Now to melt the cheese in this croissant...and get rid of a little excess earwax...and smoke a relaxing cigar.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No problem.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let's roll.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, it looks cool!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Daddy's home! I brought you kids some stuff from work!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here you go, son. Shell casings.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Point them away from your sisters when you hammer them.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Something for the sweetest little scientist in the world. A new chemistry set.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The biggest one in town.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Evidence that I love my little girl.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I brought you some flowers! A full dozen this time! No tricks!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, for now. I guess things are workin' out pretty good at your bakery job. Maybe we could order one of your cakes for Lisa's birthday.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What'd you do that for?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm not convinced.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Still on the fence.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now I believe you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He'll be here sooner or later.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, how 'bout a little stakeout music?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I like A.C.-D.C.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,DONE FOR FREE,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you've gotta try it. This way the pepperonis stay intact till they reach your stomach. Then, BAM!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You've got to roll it from the point. Here, let me show you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now let it unfurl in your stomach.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,There he is!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,There's one thing he didn't count on: my reckless indifference to human life!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, it worked, didn't it? Okay smart guy, you're going in the bag.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, wait. I left a sandwich in there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You know what your problem is? You haven't become as bad as the people we chase!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll tell you what's over! This partnership!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't take another word out of you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I can't believe Flanders dumped me. Marge, do we have any more of your extra-long Twinkies?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, what's going on?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I can see you withholding sex or withholding cake. But withholding sexy cake? I know we have to move past this, but I don't see how.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"First, why don't you and I and the cake take a shower?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hello! Hello? Anybody home? Hello?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What have you done to my family?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And how did you know I wouldn't be there?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, you'll never take me alive!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Forgot my keys.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I loved you, man!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You hang onto resentment like a Confederate widow.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but you hold onto the big things! The point is, the more I got to know you, the more I got to like you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, it's gonna be like that, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I've got you, my friend.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Phew. Now all we have to do is get out before the concrete hardens.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, dammit!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Make it life and you've got a deal.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, baby.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This counts as a parent-teacher conference!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Did he take the bait?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, he went into a construction site!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart just keeps spinning around and around and around. What's his angle?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We're doing laundry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No problem.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh, he won't get far. Not on the crappy breakfast I made for him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Our little boy has lost his mind. Let's get him.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart! Where are you, boy?! Don't worry, I won't strangle you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Absolutely -- that unpleasantness in Ecuador is behind us, my coca leaf addiction is under control , and Bart is finally trapped in that paradise above the clouds.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Is that him? No, it's just a bush. Clearly the work of Wirakocha, the trickster god.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The computer says Bart's standing on the computer. All I see is a stupid bird with a tracking chip on its leg! It doesn't add up!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, uh, she's uh...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stupid shopping list, turning food into work. Bart!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You better settle down, boy, or I'll drag you into the blind spot of that security camera...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,...and beat you with one of those big thick women's magazines with all the ads in it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmmm, you make a good case. I'll take it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You just cost me two hundred thousand dollars!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I was gonna bet it on the dogs!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That kid has become a Dennis-level menace!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart cost us fifty thousand dollars.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm going to Moe's.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't want your pity booze. I'll pay for it myself.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you look great.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well Marge, you did have that one sip of alcohol while you were pregnant...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stop it, both of you! Don't make me drive into that tree! You know I will!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lenny, it was pretty cool of you to spend your lotto winnings on your pals...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Get out here, boy! I wanna punish you before I get drunk and merciful!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You ruin everything! /,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Human garbage can to the rescue!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So at work today, we got a memo saying everyone's getting new chairs.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Talk louder? You bet. Naturally, I threw my old chair in the dumpster right away. But then Lenny said ""No, that was the new chair. That memo was two months old!"" So now I'm sitting on an orange crate. I never felt so--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's it, boy! You're going to bed without supper!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If that boy thinks I'm paying to put him through four years of puberty, forget it! Stupid kids... think I'm made of hormones...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Give me back my newspaper!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"For your information, the ""Daily Growl"" is the only newspaper that's not afraid to say how great this country is!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"How's the war going? We're winning, that's great! And our standing abroad? Fantastic!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"ALL AROUND THE SOMETHING WORLD,",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thank you, future Bart, for traveling back through time to warn us!",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Aw come on, gravity. You used to be cool!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Occupied!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Two hot chocolates, please!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Y'know, I feel sorry for you, kid. Going back to that cold, loveless family.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Take me with you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll be anything and everything you want! Don't leave me here with them!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nobody shuts out my blather!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Were we ever that stupid?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I thought of a new thing -- it's called ""biking out."" It's a combination of biking and making out.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, all the teens on bikes are doin' it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge! I love this guy!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"He rhymes! Oh, happy day!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I wish -- we were bicycling to a lake.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge Bouvier, will you not marry me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Then I now pronounce us ""just dating.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I love kissing you. I never want to knock it off.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Knock it off!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How dare you expose my children to your tender feelings! Bart! Don't you dare take your eyes off that Gameboy!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Videogames -- the reason this generation of Americans is the best ever.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, everybody pees in the pool!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eat gravel, hags!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I have the situation under control. The compass needle is pointing east.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How many times do I have to say I'm sorry?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I know -- I was hoping the number might be zero.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A really fun party? Full of colored cheeses and awesome stuff to do? Doesn't seem like your kind of thing, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh, let my Dad enjoy 'em a little longer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, get two of your own.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I'm trying to get me drunk.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, a horoscope would never lie to a pretty girl like you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I'm talking to you, at this great party!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Limbo? You mean the dance or that place where unbaptized babies go? Either way, I'm in.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Or you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,SOMETHING SOMETHING LIMBO SOMETHING,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,She's not strange! She's fun! And she doesn't get jealous when I talk to other women!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sushi fight!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,These fish died for nothing!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Here we are.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kids, this place has very special memories for your mother and me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll put a hundred bucks in your col-lege fund.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll steal it back when you're sleep-ing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why Flanders, you rogue.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All Marge and I need are a queen-sized bed and a king-sized ""Do Not Disturb"" sign.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?! But I have urges!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"He's not talking, he's yelling!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I never thought I'd say this, but... Stupid Flanders.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do you have a pineapple pizza?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is all going so fast.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I came here once with Marge. Are you Marge, Sylvia?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I want you to be Marge.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge? Is that you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, what are you doing here?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You better not be! I mean, great! We both came to rekindle our precious memories of when we were young and in love. Right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, oh, oh, I have a better idea -- let's spend the night together, right here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I feel the same way about that lamp.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen, you're a classy lady and a great sushi fighter. But you're goin' in the box.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Coming, Marge!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now let's spend the rest of the night making sweet, sweet--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Kids?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That takes care of those three -- want to go for a lakeside snuggle?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, that takes care of those three -- want to go play some lakeside Boggle?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmm, all right. The trick is to ease them off--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're just as bad as me. And you used to be better, so that makes you worse! I don't think we can ever trust each other again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ruthie, kick me away from this nightmare.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I wish I'd never met you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah. I missed her like five times.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Forever? That would be awesome.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I suppose you and Maude will be coming along as well?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, when I'm with you, I get that feeling like when I got that smart kid's report card by mistake. For a minute, I thought I had all A's. And that my name was Howard Simberg.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know we'll get married someday, and to prove it, I'll carve our names on this tree so all who are hopelessly lost in the woods can see it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I hate other people's love.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So that wasn't Marge's glider parked outside the motel five years ago! I'm getting out of this marriage while I'm still young and handsome.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,4 Ever. I couldn't even keep a promise I made to a tree. Maybe it's not too late! Maybe I can still save our love. If I just show her that carving...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Saving our marriage!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Help! Fat man hanging from a tree!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't want to let go of our special carving!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I don't want to die with us mad at each other.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know parts of our marriage are based on lies, but so are a lot of good things: religion, American history...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Awww.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now we wait for the river to freeze. If my theory of global cooling is correct.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,She blew it again! Woo-hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But we're married.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How about R?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo-hoo! Adult situations!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lemonade!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Six cups, please. And put it on my tab.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Keep moving, deadbeat -- cash only.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fine, lemonade's for babies anyway! I'm going to Moe's, for beer! Have fun drinking your lemonade, babies!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, can Daddy borrow your bike?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Moe, gimme a--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Seymour... Edna asked me to talk to you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, this is about you. Edna wants to break up.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look at it this way: you're a free man... unlike me. You have all your hair... unlike me. No kids tying you down, or a crippling mortgage that you refinanced at twenty-six percent because a dancing internet cowboy told you to... Oh, God, I hate my life!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Exactly. You're good looking, have a decent job... what lonely widow wouldn't consider you an option?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'm afraid Lenny's dead.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And you will again. Because he isn't really dead. And now this next piece of news won't seem so bad...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Y'ello!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The gay guy?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh-huh, got it. Marge, I'm going to a hardcore gay club, and I won't be home till three in the morning!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You'll always have a special place in his heart!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Anyone else want me to get rid of that special someone?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, everyone. Rotate one to your right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sweet Conclusions Break-Up Service. Oh yes, we dispose of your loved one humanely - thanks to our patented TenderDump System.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll be there in thirty minutes... or your breakup is freeee!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, if I had a hundred dollars for every customer I'd broken up, I'd have exactly this amount. 'Cause that's what I charge!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know this is hard on you, but in time you'll come to see it's for the best.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who are you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm getting' out of the break-up business and I don't know if I'll ever sleep soundly again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, so this is what this is.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Surely some holds are barred.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, it sounds really exciting and you're a delightful young lady. Now if you'll excuse me...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's going on?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Really? Well, I did bring this envelope full of money.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And these days, betting in a bar is safer than any stock, bond or real estate investment.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I want you to put it all on my little girl. And parlay with the Asian kid.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What is it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"She won! And like any prudent gambler, I know when to walk away: never!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And when you win, I win. I'll explain that to you on your deathbed.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Right, right. But will it happen this time?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just be yourself.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I wanna change my bet... I'm going against my daughter.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine. I won't look you in the eye.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Have I made the bet yet?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, for a bartender-bookie you're awfully judgmental.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... the sun did that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, sweetie, Daddy made a little extra money betting against you in the crossword tournament. You'll understand when you're a parent placing large wagers against your own children. I hope you're not mad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You sure you're not mad?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You sure you're not mad?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Teddy, can you ask Lisa if she's mad? What's that, Mr. Teddy? You're saying that you know women? And that when women say they're not mad, they're madder than ever?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,She's gone. Can you drive me home? I'm a little drunk.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lisa? Lisa?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, sweetie... please, look at your Daddy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nooooooooooooooooo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yessssssssssssssss!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa's mad at me, and now she's using Marge's maiden name instead of mine.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow... nobody gives better parenting advice than childless drunks.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I had a little help from this guy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dear Lisa, you make me so happy... really, really, really happy. Sorry, he told me I needed a hundred and forty-four letters. What was my point again? Oh right. Bouvier or Simpson, I cherish you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Kitten calendar.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What does it do?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay. What can I do for you? Please, I'm begging you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But it's glowing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I installed all the low energy bulbs!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Disposed of them in an environmentally friendly manner!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Milhouse is lookin' good -- he's got contacts, changed color, got a cool new catchphrase... Salaam alaikum!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sir? That's the kind of respect you'd have to strangle out of an American kid.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm really thirty-eight.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Bashir's great. If Derek Jeter married Mariah Carey, it wouldn't last, but I bet they'd have a kid like him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I can't believe that till I see a fictional TV program espousing your point of view.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my God. What can I do?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But we're the more powerful country for a few more years.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I guess I have no choice.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here's the plan, Marge. You keep 'em talking. I'll be listening... and quietly judging.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, interesting. Why just the other day I was reading that science is used to make bombs.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why don't I get us dessert?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I made us a little cake.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Care to cut? Watch this, Lenny.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's the matter? Don't like the taste of freedom?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Shut up, old man.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's it! Ruin a perfect evening!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm sorry -- it's just so fun and easy to judge people based on religion.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, I'll apologize.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Up-bup-bup! Don't eat that, sweetie, it's poison.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I am sorry I suspected you of being soulless murderers of innocent children. I hope we can move past this and...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dynamite?! They are terrorists! Must leave quietly.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So far so good.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge! I was right! Everybody is whatever I think they are.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I saw them unloading dynamite!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, sweetie. But if I wake up tomorrow we'll discuss it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now do Flanders!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nooooooo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hm. Usually that ends the dream.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The power of dreaming has convinced me the threat is real!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gotta prove the genie was right...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my God!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I want to apologize for being such a jerk at dinner. And I thought the best way to do that would be to come to your house and poke around.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait, wait, wait, wait... I read somewhere your people are hospitable to guests. Is that true?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Praise be Oliver.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We'll look it up in the Corona.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So... now that we're alone, um... death to America, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Homer, why are you really here?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, look at that. We're out of almond paste. Don't get up. I'll grind the almonds myself.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A computer!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm in!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Springfield mall?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,They're gonna blow it up!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just lis-ten! I'm grinding them now! Ow! My finger! Ooh, here comes the ambulance! My, you're a handsome fellow. Just get in the ambulance, Mr. Simpson. We'll see to your finger. Why thank you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow! My finger!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Everyone get out!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Run for your lives!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Run for your--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... stay where you are!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, don't blow up this mall! It has the cookie store that gives free samples!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What about the bridge?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Did we really need a bridge there?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll save you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That banner has really paid for itself over the years.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh no, no bees? Oooh, now who will sting me and walk all over my sandwiches?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pfft! Knew it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Duh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bo-ring!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Flowers -- the painted whores of the plant world.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thank you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I never dreamed the future could be scary. Let's go, Lisa. We've got some worms to save!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Worms, bees, ticks, fleas... let's go, go, go!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Animals can get sick?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're the nerd.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,There's one on Lisa!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hold still, sweetie. Daddy will kill it. And this time no screw-ups.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, remember when we were talking about our worst fears?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And mine was snakes and yours was...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Really? I thought it was Lisa with a beard of bees. Well whatever, brace yourself.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The secret is not to swallow the stingers.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"They're just drones, Lisa. They only live for like five minutes anyway. And they only have haploid cells, not diploid like me and Bart.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Which used to be a beautiful, thriving greenhouse 'til I was hired to run it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I knew it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'd do anything to cheer up my little girl.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh? But how are we supposed to combine the DNA of two strains of the same species?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You and me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah, yeah, that's what I meant too. I have no... inclination...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yep.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And she's ready for a night of anonymous sex with multiple partners.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sweetie, I have a very special surprise for you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Your bees died days ago. These are their angry, mutant descendants. And they're tough enough to live in any environment.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hm, I'm not sure. Let me check.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you guys dangerous?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A simple ""yes"" would've sufficed.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, Lisa. Where else are they gonna go?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"When you're older, you'll miss these fun activities.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, 'cause no one's making me. Buh-bye.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Could've been. If we hadn't had kids.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Toldja, Marge. Tol. Dja.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Friendship is like marriage -- the key is listening. Also, if her dog bites you, don't make a big deal out of it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, honey. If it's that important to you, you said it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Use as many big words as possible. I call ""computer."" Bart, you can have ""doorbell.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey! That was--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We... I... You come up with an excuse!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If you say so, M'lord.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If you'll show me to your bathroom, I'd like to pretend to wash my hands.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"When they make a movie from his books, does he get one, or two free tickets?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, could you take a look at a lump on my back?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I get it. Here's ten bucks.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What a racket.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, that's Bart for ya.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Seems like you and I are always talking about Bart, my son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that. We were actually just going out for brunch and I got lost. But don't worry, officer. We'll definitely have a talk with the boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I doubt it -- Friday is usually just committee assignments and procedural rules.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is it some place I have to put on a tie?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is it a place I'd look overdressed if I did wear a tie?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What about a jacket and jeans with a nice tee shirt?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And you know what else, sweetie? You and your friend Princess Nutjob inspired me to write my own fantasy novel, based on my experiences as a dad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, chapter one... uh... uh... writing is hard.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, he's ten days younger.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,If he's lucky.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The guy owns a few local businesses and everyone treats him like he's God. Well, God doesn't need his own special day!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sunday's the Lord's day, boy. Not God's. Completely different guy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If I had won Class President, I'd be the one getting thrown up in the air right now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yup -- back in high school, right before I met your mother. A simpler time when the only thing we worried about was total nuclear annihilation...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Guys that popular and confident are never truly happy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Tears of a clown.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Exception that proves the rule. If losers like me know one thing, it's that deep down, winners like him are miserable. Watch, I'll prove it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Angry nut coming through.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Vance?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Great, thanks. Listen, settle a bet: behind that smile you're dying, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Please! You've gotta have some secret agony! I bet those fancy shoes hurt your feet.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No. Yes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll just stick with my beer.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Because when Vance beat me in that election, he ruined my life.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why did you just exchange that look of guilt?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So there's a chance I actually won! I've got to dig up that ballot box!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Al Gore?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ballots... stolen... real winner unknown... what is the truth?...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've gotta know.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lenny! Wake up!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's not why I'm here. Get dressed.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,California casual.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The ballot box?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What will this box reveal? And what will I use this box for afterwards? Mismatched nuts and bolts? Recipes? I may never know.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo-hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo-hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,", or woo hoo?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes! I'm Senior Class President! I get a parking spot if the Assistant Principal isn't using it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a second. If I'd been Class President like I was supposed to, I'd be the one with the big mansion and the color TVs and the hot wife!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I still would be married to you, but you would just be hotter.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's exactly what it means. And Dondelinger took that life away from me. And the taking of a life is murder. And the punishment for murder is... well, it varies from state to state and by race... but I'm gonna find Dondelinger and tell him I know what he did last summer... twenty-two years ago... in the winter!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dondelinger!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dondelinger! I should have been Class President, but you stole the election from me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes! I want him to know that if your life doesn't turn out the way you want, there's someone else to blame.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I respect your choice. Now drive back to the clubhouse and order me a Tom Collins.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Virgin? What are you, a girl?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, Dondelinger, I want some answers.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You lie. You love me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't feel much like eating. I'll never know what would've happened if I'd have been Class President.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh? Who said that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I would've been a winner, instead of some idiot spending his Saturday night staring into a bowl of sauce. Why did fate do this to me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why? Why?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, stir! I must see more!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, unlike C.P.R., this is something I must know.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,...Debbie Pinson.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Debbie, um... Wanna go to prom with me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I got the biggest lapels, the ruffliest shirt, and the most beautiful...girl?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Debbie, I forgot I have an English paper due on Monday. Would you read ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" for me and if you could write down how Boo Radley fits into the Southern Gothic tradition, that would be great.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Homer Simpson. Class President.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A lot of great things have happened to me lately, but they're nothing compared to meeting you. May I have this dance?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Debbie. I hope you can find happiness without me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I do! Oh, right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, the way I feel about you is as real and lasting as my hairline.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sweet dreams.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thank you, mysterious weirdo.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm Class President.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"How you doin', Dad?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Honey, I'm home! Where are the kids?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, yes. That must be it. This is the best of all possible worlds. Blah, blah, blah.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I wanna live in the sauce!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I get it. You're all gonna try to convince me that my life is great just like it is, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you kidding? We couldn't even convince you that Bruce Wayne is Batman.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, come on! That millionaire playboy? He's too busy socializing at cocktail parties and managing the affairs of the Wayne foundation.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, look who thinks he's smarter than sauce.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, why would you bring me here?! It's like bringing Richard Nixon to the Watergate! Or Kevin Costner to Waterworld!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My own plaque! And one for Vice President Butthead! Cool.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Is that why you brought me here, spirits?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I guess that would be nice.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really? Sure.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, guys.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, was there another plaque here before?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now let's get something to eat.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,God no!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, that sounds like fun!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...three, two, one. Happy New Year!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're the government's problem now!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who taught you that language?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So you did learn something.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Absolutely. Insurance is the greatest deal ever. If I get hurt, I get paid. And man, do I get hurt.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What a week.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh no! Now who will sell oranges on the off-ramp?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Great jokes make me hungry. I wonder what's in the pantry...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Must be in the glove box.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This was due two weeks ago! I'm not insured! For the first time in my life I'm financially responsible for my own actions!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uninsured! Uninsured!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm not in good hands! I'm in no hands! Like a bad neighbor, no one is there!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dear. Stupid. Insurance. Company. I. Meant. To. Mail this. On time. What. Do You. Mean. Too bad? Screw. You! Heh. Heh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I won't be insured until three o'clock?! Okay, until then, I have to avoid any serious injuries or accidents on my property, or I'm ruined.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh no you don't!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I won't bore you with the truth. All I can say is that until three p.m., we must avoid all accidents and injuries or we're all going to the poor house.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine. Back. And we can't let anyone else get hurt on our property.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Me too, baby. But we gotta get real.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Book club? That's the most stupid boring thing ever. Oh, thank you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I mean, nooo!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, I just have to keep these tipsy witches safe for ten more seconds.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Kniiiife!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Got it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Mr. Burns! Why do terrible things always happen to wonderful people at three-oh-one p.m., which, for the record, is the correct time.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, plans for the weekend?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, are you mad I forgot to send in the payment?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Baby, I hope you've got snuggle insurance, 'cause I'm about to file a claim.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,OH MARDI GRAS / OH MARDI GRAS / YOU SEE A LOT OF BOO-BIES...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, where are my zydeco records?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know they do, but the Simpson Mardi Gras party has been a tradition since two days before you were born. And we spare no expense.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This counts as that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ladies, how're you doing with the float?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No problem.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, lighten up. Even Grampa's enjoying himself.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ha, ha! Eat my food! Drink up my drink! Put your coat on my daughter's bed! I command you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine. I'll invite him. But he has to wear the outfit I choose.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Flanders. Listen, uh... we're having a party...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, anyway, if you're not doing anything, and it looks like you are, you're welcome to stop by, or not.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Because I have this magical thing called a Home Equity loan. I borrow all the money I want, and the house gets stuck with the bill. Sucker.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fine, Mr. Skeptical. Give me back your beads.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Beads, please.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, don't worry. It's like when we stopped paying the phone bill. They stopped calling us. In fact, everyone did!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh man. Who'd think the first day of Lent would be such a bummer?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen, you! When you gave me that money, you said I wouldn't have to repay it till the future! This isn't the future! It's the lousy, stinking now!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That poor man. Is he okay?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry honey, we'll come out ahead. I ripped all the copper wire out of the walls.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Did I what now?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Goodbye.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Let's go, kids. I can't watch any more.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And on the zillionth day, God created hugs.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And it was gooood.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, uh, uh, uh, better let me go first. I left a little uh ""surprise"" upstairs for the new owner.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,HE SAVED OUR ASS!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No problem. Just let Sir Fix-a-lot slay this chore.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Next problem.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's so beautiful. No two are exactly alike. Though many of them are very similar.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm back, baby!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"He what?! Flanders, landlords like you are the scum of the earth! You lounge around in your Egg MacMansions and we never see you unless the rent check's late!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Some friend you are. The minute you become our landlord, you expect us to pay rent. You'd better just pray I don't find out where you live!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart! Don't forget to turn the chicken!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, you'd treat her right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, right -- like ""Dateline"" did to you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We live in a house that is trying to kill us.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Who is this ""Dad"" you speak of, Lisa Simpson?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,...Squeaky stair here... scary portrait there...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Poltergeist in the closet...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm the victim here!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Kadiddlehopper.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine. You're mad. What are you gonna do about it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine. I'll get another neighbor to buy the house and let us live in it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Flanders, you wouldn't throw us out on Christmas, would you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It is me, Jesus!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I have come from my workshop in the North Pole to say: don't evict the Simpsons!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It was... um... do you have a computer nearby?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He's nailing something to our door.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ew, that's gross.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"According to this chapter book, we have a secret weapon: ""Evictee will be granted a stay of eviction if said household includes a resident aged sixty-five or over."" Finally, a practical use for my father.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm using you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My own devices!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Flanders. You can't evict us because a senior's living here now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Will you kids knock it off? I'm trying to watch badminton!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I guess we can take a quick walk. We'll keep Grampa occupied with this DVD of Dwight Eisenhower talking about golf.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, after I paid for the ice cream cones, I said ""thank you"" and was on my way.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know it seems that way, because I'm such a vivid storyteller. Now here's another story called ""Bart's Mistake."" We were walking home when",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How could this have happened?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I can't compete with that!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Honey, don't cry. It could be worse -- at least it's not raining!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"See, I told you, it's not raining. So we're just homeless.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kids, if you get lost, remember where we are: seventy-five beds from that wall, and a hundred beds from the crazy guy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's not true. You have bug bites you can scratch.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Flanders, I promise I'll never abuse our friendship again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Never! Hooray for Stupid Flanders!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I really hate this neighborhood.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, right! And I'm married to Wonder Woman!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I'm gonna see it first!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My space toy!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We'll be talking about this together for years!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I finally feel like part of a family!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, honey, I'll be your ""seeing-eye Homer."" We're in some kind of doctor room, bunch of stuff on the walls... it's kind of hard to describe... Um, I'm gonna take my break now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wolves are taking all our women.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You just rest those rods and coddle those cones -- everything's taken care of.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is there any other way to enter a kitchen?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, rats in the kitchen. Just like that delightful movie I taped in the theater.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, he's controlling me with my hair, using me to cook a delicious sole meuniere with a celery root puree and carrots Vichy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmmm, this is good.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good, but not great. I'll go get some rat poison.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, you stupid dog -- that's Maggie's bunny!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not in front of the poison man!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whoever's biting me, stop it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why did I bring the baby and the dog to the poison store?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How am I gonna get us all across this river?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A boat!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, we're too heavy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Let's see: I need to get the baby, the dog, and the poison across the river, but I can only take one thing at a time. I can't leave the baby alone with the poison, and I can't leave the dog alone with the baby.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can't someone help me with this puzzle?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Professor Frink! Help me figure this out!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yo! Over here!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Great time to nap, Einstein!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, Maggie, dog, poison, you're all involved, so listen up. First I row Maggie over, leaving the dog and the poison. Then I row back alone, take the poison over and bring Maggie back. Then I take the dog over, come back, get Maggie, row across, and before I know it, I'm back at home!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Were you listening at all?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, I need to leave you where you'll be safe...under the watchful eyes of God. And I'll be watching you too, in case God's busy making tornadoes or not existing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I see you! I see you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I see--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Catholics!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Give me my baby back!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,'Cause she was fighting my dog and stealing my poison. Now give her back so I can take her home to my rat-infested house!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, lady, have a heart. I screwed up! I'm sure your husband does stupid things sometimes!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kids, I have to tell your Mom I lost Maggie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh no, oh no, ohhh no. There is no way Homer Simpson's gonna put on a dress and act like a nun.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Told you there was no way I would do it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you sure you don't want me to do it? 'Cause I can do it. I got the outfit right here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um... No problem, sweetie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cool it -- she's getting suspicious.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, Marge. You're the most giving person I know. Besides, i gave them another gem child to sit on their precious throne.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You told me something, but I wasn't listening!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fair enough! Kids, let's practice.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mi-mi-mi-miiiii!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That was good, but Lisa, you're still complaining from your throat, not your diaphragm.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maybe it's beef stew!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hot tubs!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Guys, what's it like?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I want to buy your fanciest hot tub!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Please, can I get it, Marge? Please? Please?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Beats me. / I'unno. / Please, please, please!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm on it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Go back to your day spas!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Interesting proposal. Now with an opposing point of view: bubbles.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Flanders! Why don't you join us? Afraid you'll get your moustache wet?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmm. Probably a reminder to relax more.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what happened to the bubbles?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Dad, I never knew you had dreams, or emotions.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, who said anything about a jar?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay... ""Pitch in the Negro Leagues,"" I can think of at least two problems with that... can't read that one, my thumb's over it...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Have one more beer at O'Flanagan's Pub... We'll do that one!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This place is in Ireland?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lousy old man -- makin' me look up at an airplane!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sir, I brought my father thousands of miles just to drink at your bar.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gimme a beer and a shot of whiskey!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You okay, Dad?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I miss her.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, Dad, was there anything on your list about being cheated by an Irishman?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, boyo -- how about a tall cool one? How about you, Greensleeves? Irishmen love to get drunk.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Who are you, stuttering Fonzie? What about you, bicycle pants?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Our first sale!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Our first refund.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, look at 'em crowding the bar! There's Sully, and Mack, Jimmy D. and Jimmy B.! What can I get ya, boys -- the usual?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We are so screwed!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ireland doesn't like pubs anymore. It's as if Danish people stopped liking sleek modern design.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, we need help. Someone who can make money with a bar that has no customers and zero charm.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe, something terrible has happened! The Irish have become hardworking and sober!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, what can't people do in modern Ireland?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,People can't smoke indoors in Ireland!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe, you were right!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, ""Da,"" it looks like all your ""der"" have come ""ter.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't tell if those are questions or statements.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, Dad. We'll get out. America is the New York Yankees of countries -- powerful and respected until the year two thousand.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It was apt.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Let me say I've always admired the Irish. Knute Rockne, Larry Bird, and especially Mr. Potato Head.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But I ask you, who does smoking actually hurt, except the smokers, those around them, and the unborn children of the pregnant women we let in free on Expectant Mothers drink free night?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So I hope you'll forgive two well-meaning Americans for trying to take Ireland back to the good old days of ""Angela's Ashes."" Thank you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my God, she fainted! Let's go get smelling salts!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Suckers!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Reverend Lovejoy? You deliver pizza now? But we didn't order a pizza. But you forgot the pizza anyway. Marge, the pizza place screwed up again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You don't get it, Padre. My old lady and I have a thing goin' on. We don't need a piece of paper to keep it real.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I need that paper quick!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little bastard...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sweetie, any place I'm marrying you is the most romantic place in the world.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, this time I'm going to give you the wedding you deserve. Let's get out of here!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello. It's me, Lance Romance.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Your first mission is to look out the window.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you deserve a wedding day that unlike our children, was planned in advance. So -- will you marry me -- in style?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Did you hear that, Santa? She said yes! Yes! Now, back to your cold, airless tomb.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How'd you check?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Check out this rocket ship cake, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maybe we could bury the rocket ship inside the cake. And that would be a big surprise because I'd forget about it pretty quick.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Chocolate.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What if we...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But there is, Marge! The first two letters...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why not?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, uh, maybe you should take a break from wedding planning. I think you're becoming a... Bridezilla.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No matter what I do, Marge yells at me. If she's like this now, what will she be like after we get married?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's going on? What's with all the darkness? Hello? Marge! Where am I?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the? I'm chained up like a common bicycle!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who would do this to me?! It would have to be someone who could afford a chain.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I have to marry Marge!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just so you know, you're making a pretty bad first impression.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I miss you so much.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You idiot! How am I ever going to find the key to the... ooh, here it is!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"To get the key I have to lick through a lollipop? Oh, how awful.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whose side are you on?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Malge! Ahmiss oo. Ahmiss oo so mug...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm gonna say this for the last time: Bart, if this is one of your pranks, very funny.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What's fun about fire ants? They're-- Oh, you're being sarcastic.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thank you, that's very... More sarcasm.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just see that my fiancÃ©e Marge gets this -- my wedding vows.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge! Moe and Maya are here for a double date.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I hope this day is as perfect for you, as the day we met was for me. You always find the one grain of sugar in the salt shaker that is I. With each marriage I get a little better -- maybe after a thousand, I'll be worthy of you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I miss you. I miss the kids. God help me, I even miss your sisters.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm not sure what happened. I was kidnapped, then tortured, then I fell into a surprisingly sound sleep. When I awoke, I felt refreshed. Then I was blindfolded, and two sobbing trolls threw me out of a van onto our lawn.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Won't it dry up in a few days and fall off in the bath?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm sorry, honey. I wanted so badly to give you a fancy wedding.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A rocket ship wedding cake -- just what I always wanted!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I love to see this!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This is no time to pat the bunny, Maggie. Daddy's watching a very important Mid-Atlantic Hockey League Conference Semi-Final do-over game.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stop him, Babando!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I will, when it's not sports season. I just want to know how the game ends.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wha-wha-what's the score?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The score, damn you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I will never... know... the score!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge. This is a definite high point for our marriage.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's ridiculous. Who's your daddy, Maggie? Who's your daddy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,He is pretty good with her.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look Marge! It's just what you want. Me spending the day with Muggsy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you're not naggy. You just set the bar impossibly high.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Impossibly high. Now, let's get started on the greatest daddy-daughter day ever!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not even heated up. Typical dog.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This is it, Maggie -- the place where Daddy goes every morning.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, you learn your numbers from these billiard balls while Daddy gets happier and happier and then sadder and sadder.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe, what are you doing?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Maggie could play out there... while I watch her from in here. Whaddaya say, Maggie?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, her first enabling.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hello Maggie... hello Maggie.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, Maggie made some new friends.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, burrowing your head into your Daddy. A sign that my baby is happy and confident.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I can too! ""There once was this guy from an island off the coast of Massachusetts... uh, Nantucket, I think it was. Anyway, he had a most unusual personal characteristic... which was... um... uh...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,There you are!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Aww. Innocent babies whistling nonchalantly. How sweet. Maggie will be back to play with you tomorrow.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How would I know?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I have not! Oh right, you think I do.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Pleased to meet you. Uh, perhaps this is inappropriate, but I have a mechanical question while the kids are out of the room, that I can't help wondering about.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"In a nuclear power plant, just how is nuclear energy turned into electricity?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man oh man, slap a ring on that!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here we are, Maggie. That park you love...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,See you when the moon comes out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man, that made me thirsty.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll save you, Maggie!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm telling!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, sweetie, you saved me. Well, I promise that wherever you go in this world, I will always be there for you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Maggie, I love you from the tip of your toes to the bow on your hair with the red blinking light. God bless your mother for making you with me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whatcha watchin', honey?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I'm good at beginnings.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not a thing in the world.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe, this was a great thing for you. You went from sitting on the sidelines to getting in the game. And sometime when you least expect it, you'll realize that someone loved you. And that means someone can love you again. And that'll make you smile.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm glad they suspended Milhouse. He's a bad influence on you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, I think Milhouse is ""El Barto."" Hmmmm.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And now, you're gonna visit your Grampa while I park around the corner and take a nap.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't shake your fist at me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Boy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, man, I don't want any trouble. C'mon -- here, here, just take my wallet. Leave me alone, okay?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it's even worse when you know it has a name.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, we came to an appointment in the middle of the day. That's the most a parent can do.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We done here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, busboys get all the chicks.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, girls come and go. But you'll always have your family.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know, I know.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Big deal! I could juggle five pins if they let me use a unicycle.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,'Ut 'uz it 'ay?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh man, I love Saturdays!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, this is great, honey. Thanks for telling me about it. I hope you don't mind I invited Lenny.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, lamb-kebab!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, chicken-kebab!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, fire-kebab!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Water!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why... you... little...!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Burn, Barty, burn!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is it 'omplimentawee?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It is? 'Ey every-ody, 'eck out I 'ompliment!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I held up two, for ""peely!""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, at least I can eat again!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mmm, cherry.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Too much cherry!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, lemon. That'll stop the cherry.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Doctor, why is this happening to me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't eat tacos?! Oh my God -- what day of Mayo is it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I still taste over-tones of pink!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hm. It feels like food. But it has no flavor whatsoever.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What else do they got?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man, who comes up with this stuff?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't have one.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, from now on, I'm eating all my meals here at school -- with you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, come on, relax, I won't embarrass you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh... can I work it off? Don't worry, I won't embarrass you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"OH, I'M BIG AND YELLOW / AND I'M SERVIN' JELL-O / IF YOU'RE A FELLOW AND YOU WANT SOME JELL-O / YOU'D BETTER BELLOW / HEY, BIG GUY / GIMME SOME JELL-O",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Up-bup-bup. No Jell-o for you, Bart -- it'll keep you up at night. Like last week when you crawled into bed with me and Mommy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sure is hot back here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, there we go.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, I won't embarrass you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Buddy, I'm here to eat, not make interesting conversation.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I know when I'm not wanted. Am I wanted?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hi, Homer Simpson. Mind if I sit near your son? Mine sucks.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, he's terrified of you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa -- you come to school to help him get good grades? Isn't that why we pay public school teachers those enormous salaries?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well I hope your son enjoys being driven around by the President of the United States.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, you don't see many presidents doing that. Maybe L.B.J. -- you know, at the end.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't have to ""helicopter"" Bart -- I've got a backup plan called ""Lisa.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my God, my son's a loser and my daughter's a loner. Way to go, Marge!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, where have you been?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No time. I'll just deduce where you were from a list of possibilities in my head.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That makes sense. Movin' on.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...if we don't get more involved in their lives, Bart and Lisa are gonna be failures. Failures who work for... Noah!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Aren't you the one that usually worries about stuff?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If Marge doesn't worry about the kids... then that leaves... me! Help me, mayonnaise!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look at all these helicopter parents. I hope Bart's doing okay on his own.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,There's no future in that!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A thousand dollars?! That's what my house is worth!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Time to take control of my son's life. Let's see, what can he build...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Too obvious.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gotta be something from Earth.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're no help.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Perfect!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I did it! I helped my son! Helicopter Homer away!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Black Hawk down! Black Hawk down!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, I found this book in the ""What's Wrong With My Daughter"" section of the bookstore.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It tells you how you can get popular.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sweetie, our country was founded by a clique: the Continental Congress. Dolphins swim in cliques. Those are my two examples.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And to show you how this book works, I will demonstrate on some rats...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Let's try what chapter seven calls ""Un-sults"" -- insults disguised as compliments. Hey, Lenny -- it takes a lot of courage to wear suspenders when you're not in the circus.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"See, it works. And un-sults are just the beginning. There's also envy-tations, hate-hugs, spamming with faint praise and... Hey everyone, wanna go get frozen yogurt?",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Dad, I don't have the right words to say how I really feel about you, but at least I know how to beat up a guy who does.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just with indifference.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really? Me? You mean it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I've been waiting for this day for so long. The year is nineteen forty-six. In a war-torn world, a single flower blooms. And that flower is an angry Japanese monster named Godzilla. How am I doin', Dad?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fortunately there was one man who could help: Colonel Tom Parker. The Colonel took this monster, cleaned him up and put him onstage under the name ""The Rolling Stones."" The first concert was a sellout, with many, many, many people eaten. But those that survived raved about the undeniable harmonies and brutally honest lyrics of what they had just seen.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,...and that lasted about five years. But then Godzilla dropped out for a while to do movies. All of the awful movies we see now today in the drive-ins that no longer exist.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw c'mon, Marge. There's nothing funnier than a good ol' bonk on the head.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not funny.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"None for me, Marge. I get free donuts at work! I can see them now... in the break room, beside the fridge, the pink cardboard box awaits...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...groaning with a ""United Nations"" of donuts: jellies rubbing elbows with cream-filled, the masculine contours of the box juxtaposed with the feminine curves of the treats themselves...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No pink box?! Wha -- what's going on?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You... can't... do that...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,D'oh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,They took away our donuts at work! All I've had are my meals!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I guess these days headhunters can be anything.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You nuclear workers have no idea how valuable you are. Times have never been better for your industry, now that all the protesters who marched in front of nuclear power plants are dying off from radiation poisonin'.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do you want to come in and get your sister with me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Watch your language! Now, why the hell not?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Bart, you say that now. But when you're grown up, you'll just think it. Now you stay here and I'll get your sister.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man, a lion would not want to see that on his x-ray!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Goodbye, power plant. I'd better get out of here before I have a meltdown.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You can't win us back with mere donuts.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That is the most amazing donut I've ever tasted.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,AND YOU LIKE POTATO...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,AND YOU LIKE TOMATO...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,potato!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,TOMATO!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,TOGASAKI-ROTHMAN!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Songwriters who are stuck!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, sweetie. With me at your side, our toast will do just what it's supposed to: steal focus from the bride.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,See you at five on the dot. Phone kisses!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"She's not my girlfriend. She's a girl who I married, who used to be my friend.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Today is your lucky day."" Yeah, pfft!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, any part of a cookie you can't eat is just a waste of time--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmm, maybe this is my lucky day.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A disc? Please be compact, please be compact! Woo-hoo!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Here we go.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"OOOH, WHAT A LUCKY MAN...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I IS! OOOH, WHAT A LUCKY MAN I IS! BOO-WEEE-BOO-WEEE-WEE-DOO-DOO-DEE-DEE-DOO-DOO",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, line, move! Maybe it'll speed up if I make ""can you believe this"" noises. Oh for goodness sake--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...Yo no creÃ­a en fortunas, pero entonces me saliÃ³ una galleta...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...que decÃ­a que hoy era mi dÃ­a dichoso. Primero no lo creÃ­, pero entonces me caÃ­ contra la maquina de dulces, ay, ay, ay!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm almost there... I can see the church steeple in the distance...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh-oh, here comes a train.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Tickets, please. Hey, where's your ticket? Leave me alone! Why you little...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No time to pretend we're friends! Lotto me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"One, six, seventeen, twenty-two, twenty-four, thirty-five.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I did it! I'm gonna make it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm a-comin', Marge!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm gonna make it! I'm gonna make it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I didn't make it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm alive! And surrounded by the...people I love the most in the...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Could you scooch over a bit?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll try.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Barn, thanks for picking up the money for me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, what should I buy first? Hitler's baseball? A mirror that gives me advice?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge? What are you doing?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here I am a millionaire, and I can't even help the woman who gave birth to me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Barney, that's brilliant! Just for that, you can help yourself to anything from this tree.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I know. It's where I hide my adult magazines.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Catch, boy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oops -- the Frisbee went into the bushes. Why don't you go find it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A box? No way!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A new washing machine? No way!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You go rent us a truck.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And now, Marge's secret benefactor is going to get her the luxury she's always dreamed of: a toaster wide enough for bagels. I'll just take out a little money from my ""local branch.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hm. Not as much money as there used to be.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why... I'm just...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lenny... and Carl... A fortune cookie... I ran into the candy machine... and I found an Emerson, Lake, and Palmer...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, if I was interested in fun, I would've run away the day you were born.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're right. I have been acting like Telethon Jerry Lewis when I should've been acting like rest-of-the-year Jerry Lewis. Will you teach me how to put myself first?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Um... your cut of what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do you think you could use someone like me in your band?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I said someone like me, I didn't say me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look at me! I'm flying, like Superman's dog!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Race you to the cockpit!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry boy. You have school tomorrow.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"With that attitude, you'll never super in one of my buildings!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, I am through spoiling you. First thing tomorrow you're going back to the rotten life you've always enjoyed.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Blackmail your father in space, will you?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Up -- that's my chair, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um, on second thought, boy, why don't you take my chair?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I agreed to no such thing!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where and what time?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Never!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What do I wear?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine. Let me just get my harness pads.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, this has gone too far -- I quit! As soon as I finish these oats.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not if I tell her first.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, I'm taking off the blindfold...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Surprised?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, soaring above the forgiving beauty of nature, I have something to confess. Um... I wasn't there for that wedding toast because... I was buying a lottery ticket.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You have a right to be angry. Furious! And even though that ticket won a million dollars and--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, yes, well, um... taxes took out a lot... I spent a ton on those things for the family... and um, I didn't know you could rent a balloon...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, but I have one more thing to show you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, those groves of cherry blossoms will bloom every year, to remind the world of the sweetest, most forgiving woman who ever lived... am I off the hook?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,AND YOU LIKE POTATO...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,AND YOU LIKE TOMATO...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Carl, you're a liar, but I love it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, Mr. Burns, couldn't we patch the leak tomorrow? It's date night.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm sorry I missed dinner, honey. We still have time to catch a movie. That can be romantic.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It'll make a walk on the beach seem like a punch in the face.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, we came here to enjoy the movie and we're going to enjoy the movie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We're outta here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How about bromance?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dude...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This bromance just got interesting.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Would you like to wear mittens or go commando?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What, they come here on Saturday night to clean the ice? Losers.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, this is perfect for both of us! It's got bowling for me and sweeping for you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Let us curl, M'lady. Let us throw and sweep a'twain until the Heavens themselves drop their jaws in wonder and envy! And afterwards there'll be beer, and cocoa, with marshmallows floating in the foam. And if, from now till the end of time, someone should ask what we were doing on the eve of the seventeenth of November, we shall proclaim that WE WERE CURLING!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Curling is real.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Great curling reference.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,There's a Winter Olympics?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Olympic trials, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sweep! Sweep! Left, right! Left, right! Back-and-forth!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pack your winter coat! We're going to Canada's warmest city!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,She used to be my therapist.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How can I ever thank you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I couldn't hear the last thing you said! Goodbye forever!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"OH, A PORK BAO, A SHRIMP BAO, EVERYWHERE A BAO BAO / HOMER SIMPSON WINS A GOLD / SLIDING ROCKS ON ICE... BAO BAO!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my God, I'm holding back the team. But our marriage is based on curling. What am I gonna do?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hm...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's my Marge! High-five!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's stuck!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can I help you with that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll do it myself. When we do things together, they always turn out badly -- for me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooo, you're hot when you're horny...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooo, you're mad when you're angry...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you're really good with your left hand.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But this time, on ice!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,U.S.A.! U.S.A.!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oops.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How's this for a date night?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wonderful, Homie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, the Simpson family is a long line of horse thieves, deadbeats, horse beats, dead thieves, and even a few...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Alcoholics.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen, Lisa. You're gonna find more than you bargained for. If I were you, I wouldn't dig into the past. I lived in some of that past, and I got out for a reason.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I warn you: I don't know what's in there but if it's about a Simpson, you ain't gonna be proud.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Me neither. For once, the Simpsons were in management!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good point, Bart.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's a great story, Lisa! And you should stop reading right there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well I don't. The motto of the Simpsons is, ""quit while you're ahead.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Time for bed, sweetie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You still reading that thing? I'm warning you: when something goes into that vent, it shouldn't come out. Ever!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I got an idea: you can march to Selma -- and tell her she's ugly!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The library? Bart, can you believe we're married to those nerds?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Leave me alone! I have shares to crop!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen, Wrinkles! If you know something that'll cheer up my little girl, you'd better spill it. Or I can make things very uncomfortable for you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,About Virgil.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And that's why I earn less than my white co-workers!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So that's why I love drinking so much.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'est la vie, baby.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Credit card offer, overdue bill... credit card offer, overdue bill... huh, what's this?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the... you're a month behind on homework?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A little!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I say this boy needs more homework.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't have to do it with him, do I?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pile it on! I want him to be Korean by the time he's done.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hm. Clean dishes. I either have to unload them, or, uh...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No problem. You can unload.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my! A child who doesn't enjoy school? Hello? Hollywood?! You want to buy the movie rights to this incredible story? A million dollars? Deal! Now I have to write it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey! You're supposed to be doing your homework! No more TV for you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Until your homework is done, the only place your butt is safe from my foot is in that chair.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Too late, Marge. I already used a ""prayer block"" on your prayer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, why aren't you doing your homework!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You don't get to relax till you get to the bottom of this homework stack.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well don't be wrong in front of our son!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah? Well .,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No line... near the men's room... I see no reason to question your choice.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the?! Then I wanna eat at Moe's Express!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That was last week, and you're still bringing it up!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well how could I ever hit the hamper if you don't let me practice!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fine. I was gonna apologize, but now I'm not going to!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I was too! The words were in my brain!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No freedom! I have no freedom around this house! After sex, I'm not talking to you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You can't sex fire me, I sex quit!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Must win fight... must win fight...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let me say to you all: I'm pretty sure this is not a dream!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my God, I killed her!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I've got to apologize. Once again, sleeping at work has saved my marriage!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Must apologize. Must apologize.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We can't let Bart drive us apart. He's the reason we had to get married.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart? Bart who? I'm being cute.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Awesome breakfast, Marge! Breakfast in bed is so much better than breakfast in a chair.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whatever. Knock yourself out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You may not realize this, Bart, but your mother and I have been fighting about you a lot lately. And I've realized our marriage is more important than your future. From now on, you're on your own.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, Marge? I don't want to ruin the moment, but you got something stuck between your-- ohhh...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I love watching you knit. It reminds me of watching pictures download on our old dial-up modem. Remember that day we brought it home and it was all eee, ooo, eee, ooo, onnnggg!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't know, don't care.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm saving my yelling for where it does some good. Lisa! You're a wonderful child! Keep up the good work!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, I thought we were chilling out for the sake of our marriage.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine. I'll do both at once. We should both take a role in vacation planning!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, there's a nickel.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well I'll be! There's a sofa in here!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Must... squeeze... harder!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And no TV!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And when you're out of my sight, you must constantly Twitter me exactly what you're up to, even though I don't know what Twitter is and have no desire to find out.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks to our new G.P.S., I'll have you at school in no time.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Meters?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid kid. Thinks he's smarter than a computer.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Seatbelts, kids!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey boy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Your mother thinks I'm working on the car!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Talk to Grampa. He used to be a man.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's all that happened? And I got to miss work?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I could kiss you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well maybe you guys should look for easier jobs.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're halfway home, lady.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No! If you go near her one more time, we'll be sued into the poor house and have to eat garbage forever.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, don't worry, boy. I know a wholesome way to take your mind off girls.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And the glasses smell like the last guy who wore them had pizza!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look at that.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't! Latkes aren't as good as American pancakes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,They're okay with applesauce.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A truckload of applesauce!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Flanders, that stuff's been here for thousands of years. But the breakfast buffet at this hotel, which is included in our package, closes in ten minutes!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,After we see the stations of the omelet bar.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He's going for the record! He's going for the record!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Flanders, you're not supposed to help him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ned, I'm an American tourist. I'm just here to see some sights, try goofy new food and spread some shekels with my Carolina Panthers credit card.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pan-thers!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,If you say it like Dracula I will.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"I'm not, it's my ringtone.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Y'ello. This is he. Yeah I wanted to know: do you deliver falafels to the top of Mount Zion? Great. I'd like a large falafel with pepperoni, sausage and extra cheese. Yes, I know what a falafel is.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey boy, we're supposed to be acting religiousy. What are you up to?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Give my Dad another heart attack?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whuh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm sorry. It's just that these tours are so exhausting. You're jetlagged, you're walking around all day... it's so hard to sleep knowing Marge and the kids are all stuck in one small room.... and it's so nice and cool in the tomb of the unknown savior...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Porky Pig?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But he is buried here, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Chickpea Fizz.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whatever. It's your camera.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Your parents made you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What? But I thought we'd be neighbors in Heaven. Goofing on all the new dead people...,,,,,

Homer Simpson,There's sand in my shoe!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Good luck surviving without me!,,,,,

Homer Simpson,Oh yeah. Gotta keep track of those.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The messiah! Has the passports.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm more than okay! I am the Messiah, come to save the world! Look upon me and shudder!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"As you wish, but look not upon her with lust. And do not send her friendly emails. That's how it begins.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The Dome of the Rock? Messiah, away!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This one says ""Carolina Panthers!""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Messiah says !,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Attention Christians, Muslims, and Jews. I have come to gather you into a new faith. From now on you shall be called Chrismujews.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Because when you get down to it, aren't all religions the same? They tell you what to eat, when to pray... how this imperfect clay that we call man can mold itself to resemble the divine. But we can never attain that ultimate grace while there is hatred in our hearts for each other.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Celebrate your commonality. Some of us don't eat pork. Some of us don't eat shellfish. But all of us love chicken!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Spread the word! Peace and chicken!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, if I made any sense today, it's because all the stuff you've told me all these years has finally seeped in.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can I buy you a twelve dollar turkey sandwich?,,,,,

Homer Simpson,I'm pounding Melchizedeks!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! I'm drinking my salary!,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Okay, left hand: Rembrandt!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... this is my lunch.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Eat my lunch?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, I will!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You don't think I'm going to?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,There's always a catch.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Patty and Selma are dead? Woo hoo! A double funeral!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Please tell me they suffered.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,G-g-g-g-hags!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Smithers, our lives are awesome, thanks to you. And because I know you ""like your loafers light,"" I want to give something back.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Use that image any way you want.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh listen... can I leave a little early tomorrow? My kid has a thing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Smithers. What a marshmallow.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't have a thing with my kid tomorrow!,,,,,

Homer Simpson,Do you ever wear your police pants to regular things?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,From fast food to fine dining?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah. All the time. They say it's 'cause I'm overweight.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's some big underwear.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay. Ever been to Moe's?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah -- sorry I was such a jerk about it.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, Sarah. Clancy was there for me. And I'll be there for him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oops.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ahhh, that is so much better than hospital beer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't die on me, Clancy. You said our friendship was special. Well if it was so special, wake up you fat sack of...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You saved my life. And I came here every day to make sure you pulled through.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Clancy, I haven't seen my family in days. Would you mind if I went home now?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, if you really want me to stay...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine! I'll stay a little more.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Playing nursemaid to Chief Wiggum.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, maybe I lied. But you've been so needy... ""I'm hungry,"" ""I'm itchy,"" ""that's not my blood type...""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey man, you planted that!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, everything reminds me of Clancy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Everything.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I have an idea. But I must go alone. My car is filled with printer paper I stole from work.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Chief. I uh, brought a thirty-two piece chicken bucket.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I was kind of ungrateful. You did save my life.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We're not gonna get whacked. Because you're Chief Clancy Wiggum, and you're gonna figure a way out of this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, faith is what you have in things that don't exist. Your awesomeness is real.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I know just the guy.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Now, on to the next funny booth.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, so is getting a real job.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A churro you can eat in the shower?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm not usually one to take the word of a Dane... plus, how can I afford it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Months?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmm, tie it to my car and you've got a deal.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm starting to regret it already.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yup, I Al-Gored it pretty good. Where's my Grammy for audio book narration?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my goodness! It means we're traveling back in time! I can warn President Lincoln to dump his wife before she goes crazy!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that's just great. I discover electricity and they want to take it from me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, local utility? You greedy bastards have gouged Homer Simpson for the last time.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The Simpsons are off the grid! And so far it's going great!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Gentlemen, tonight's game is brought to us by something special. The kite's best friend, the flag's partner in patriotism, you've seen cherubs blow it from map corners -- the wind!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, I'll go see what's wrong!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the? Who turned off the wind?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh. Well I'm not crawling back to big electricity! From now on, the Simpsons are living intermittently.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The wind may have stopped working, but my brain nev...er does. Check it out, gang.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But we haven't read the minutes of last week's meeting!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You used to be nicer!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now we're cookin' with wind!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nothing is ever right for you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Be careful! If you see a downed power line, do whatever it is people are supposed to do in that situation.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We'll have to eat Thanksgiving dinner off regular plates like animals!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right -- let me get my tool belt.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man, who are these belts made for, French supermodels?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sure. Lisa, bring the car around.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Haven't you learned anything from watching Bart drive?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, how hard can it be? We're just rolling it into the ocean from the beach. It's not like it's stuck in the bottom of a well or in a Mexican prison.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, it's dinner time!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But that would make a great movie.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That whale's not gonna die! We're busting him out of prison, no matter what you say, Escobar! God, this thing writes itself.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Coming!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, we'll need the town's strongest men to roll the whale back in the water.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hm. We need a better idea. We'll have to find the town's smartest men.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"One, two, three, tug!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It was my idea to put the whale in the water.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, honey. Right now she's lying on God's beach.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Lisa, I'm sorry. I tried my best. I know it's really hard when you discover your dad isn't perfect.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm trying to be a sensitive father, you unwanted moron! Lisa, where were we?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Of course.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It kills me to see her like that. And if there's one thing I can't stand it's being killed.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, Lisa, I know you miss your whale. So I got you a pet that will never die. An invisible dog.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, look. He's doing his business.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey! Not on the rug! You bad dog! Ow! Ow! Ow! Stop biting my leg! Ow! Alright, that's it! You're going outside!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bad dog! Stop!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why couldn't I be eaten by a giraffe? That would be fun!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nature is a toothless dying hag! We are gonna save those whale babies!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm taking it on a test drive from the boat store! Get in!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shark week just got cancelled.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh come on! Leave me alone! I'm trying to save your precious whales!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You like sharks?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Typical eco-jerks -- using words to talk!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sharks, innocent? Please. Every year they kill a couple of people who do a series of stupid things. The shark's reptilian brain understands only one thing: the crime of murder...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, a baby whale. My diet is working.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, maybe the blood will scare the sharks off!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, buddy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I'd do anything for a sweet intelligent mammal, by which I mean you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Absolutely. He's young, he's got two cute kids... he'll be moving in with a sexy lady octopus in no time. They'll have to sell their old place... too many memories. But if I'm not mistaken, there's a little whale-a-puss on the way.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I want some of that!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Guess what company had a giveaway at Moe's last night?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Keep guessing...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What's it say, boy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmmm. Good mac and cheese.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll have to check it out sometime.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmm.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I am pretty full.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm on my way!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Golf ball-sized hail!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo-hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,/,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right! All right!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm goin' home. It's not safe in here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey boy, whatcha doing?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My little Einstein.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A phony bird call?! That means Marge is coming! Everyone, act legal!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, uh... The one place the cameras can't see is right here in our backyard so I'm charging people to do whatever they want -- isn't that wonderful?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Remember how you wanted me to get that expensive operation? Well, now I can afford a motorcycle!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who wants feet steak?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh no! I don't have to listen to you. If I'm not on camera, you can't see me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Everyone in this town is sick and tired of you looking over their shoulder. ""Don't leave your sprinklers on in the rain!"" ""Don't burn that pile of ventriloquist dummies!""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Later. Later.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You see, Ned... your city-wide nagging compressed all of our town's misbehavior into one small place...creating a glittering diamond of super evil.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"God created the devil? Finally, He did something cool.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, if you ask me, you were trying to play God.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You can help me take out those cameras.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Moe's leaving town?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I like beer, hot dogs, and long blackouts on the beach.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cleaning the gutters?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cartoons! Everybody be quiet!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, Marge, what were we talking about?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, honey. I wasn't listening. And I won't be listening now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, I'm a bit of an expert on the female gender, and I can tell you: women don't mean anything by anything.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I hear what you're saying, Lisa -- nothing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Into the playpen, sweetie. And if you get hungry, there's lobster!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's from Moe!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Moe is running off with one of our wives?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I got Marge!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge! Are you running off with Moe?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're losing me? Or you're leaving me?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Aw dammit!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can't talk! Must text!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, have u left me 4...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, Marge and I don't have any problems. We never even fight anymore.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe, my in-laws are coming. I need something strong enough that I forget I hate them, but not so strong that I tell them I love them.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, this is crazy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Flanders?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lousy--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You take that back!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Go ugly up someone else's house, you penis-curling she-devils!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm doomed.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... I do.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I was there when your wife got to Moe's, being my usual effervescent self...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, Padre. How innocuous are your flashbacks?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The ferry will be back in ten minutes. It'll take us home... to find out the truth.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Today's the first, which means it was last month, which means you're being ridiculous.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Otto, you got to get us back to town!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,She's packing her bag!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thirty-nine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge! No! Stop packing your--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Painting supplies?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're not leaving me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Marge, you not leaving with Moe is the best thing that never happened to me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe, I don't know whether to punch you or kiss you... so I'm gonna do both.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why should I? The city's broke! They can't afford to enforce their precious laws!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cookies... so delicious... must buy house.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge... get loan pre-approved... offer over asking... waive inspections... two-day escrow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,...initial the radon disclosure... and done.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But my loan has already been sold in pieces to banks, hedge funds, and municipalities across the globe!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man, you're good with the tools when you want to be.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Or Frasier on ""Frasier.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stupid kid, fooled by a silhouette.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ice cream!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nothing is ever boobs or ice cream.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, the bathroom scale is lying again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, Sideshow. I'm gonna do to you what you shoulda done to my son a long time ago!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's like you're a Chinese empress!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I'm not a locksmith!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man, that dude does not like Bart.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mexico! AndalÃ©! AndalÃ©! Arriba!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Help us! Help us, for the love of God! Won't somebody help us?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh yes, I'd like... um... how do you say taco in Mexican?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, that's exactly the word I want to translate.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah, yeah, right. Uh, just give me one of those crispy shells with meat in it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stop! Stop! Stop!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That is disgusting.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmmmm. Not ugly enough. I want something that looks like this...had a baby with this...and it got sat on by this.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my God.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You never fail to nauseate me, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I wanted to, but your mother said kids might tease you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Half an hour to show time, your ugliness.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But if we win this, we get a gift certificate.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It doesn't matter.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You can't close! I'll have to go home and drink better beer at half the price in natural lighting!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, can't a guy rush home from work to see his beautiful--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah. Now what am I supposed to do?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, since Moe's is closed again, I thought I'd help you cook dinner.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What are we watching?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,After the title page it's Bob Dole's memoirs.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now that I have all this free time, I thought I would do you a huge favor.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I organized the kitchen. I labeled everything with a label maker...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I also mixed all the spices together into one super spice!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh. What kind of ventilating is that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, Marge. I can't believe you're taking me to a sports bar.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Watchin' hockey! Watchin' 'em pass that puck! Oh yeah!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, the Long Island Ice Teas?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, that place was for diehard sports fans, not guys like me who are only fans when their team makes the playoffs. So, I decided to take apart the washing machine to see where that penny I left in my pants went.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, those guys are all crooks. They charge you for parts and labor? Pick one, buddy! I can do this just fine by myself.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, I got it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge! You ruined my shot!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That was awesome. I feel like the Tiger Woods of sex.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's four AM -- you kids should've been in bed a half hour ago!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, the Nobies!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lucky.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I would kill for that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Arctic Circle! I just got that!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How easy am I?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can my son come too? He knows what to do when I swallow my tongue.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,They fight and bite? I never go to Europe without learning something.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Another good one...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Did you say a Hague?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait! Not so fast! We found something to save Krusty.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, what region is America?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! We're Region One! We're Region One!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No fair! We just went to church!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fifty bucks each?! That's your life savings?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,HIS STRIKE ZONE'S THE SIZE / OF A TUNA FISH CAN...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Five hundred dollars? That's, like, ten dead Grampas! Some of us stuck to our limit, Marge. And I would've loved to rent this carpet cleaner another day!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, it's a cat -- I'm not sure it's the cat.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know what, honey? Just because we can't afford to keep that handbag, doesn't mean that you two can't have one night at the most glamorous place in town.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"After Bart, that bag's the best mistake we ever made.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, Marge -- let's hit the buffet.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you don't want to wait for that buffet -- Wiggum's making his move!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sure, sure!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let me just grab one more shrimp.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I believe this stranger!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Check and mate.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute, Marge. Don't you realize what just happened?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You got to enjoy that bag for nothing! We can buy stuff we can't afford, temporarily own the hell out of it, and then indignantly bring it back for a full refund.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hide a sandwich in this hat. ""Mary Poppins"" myself to work with this umbrella.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, the luck lasts longer! Thanks to the power of returns, this store is our closet!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Come in. Come in. Don't wipe your feet.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I wish. What the hell are you doing?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, everyone onto the hot tub.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on on, the cardboard's fine.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good afternoon. I'd like to return this merchandise. Wrong size, wrong color, not as pictured, and other reason please explain.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes... uh... maybe I'll just come back during someone else's shift... Is Claire working today? She's a real sucker.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How do you know my name?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's not what you think... I came here to warn them... yes, to warn them about, um...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes! I mean no! I mean... You'll never get me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I have to sign a release so you can broadcast this, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Initial there, and... Never!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can you tell me when this is gonna be on? I'm thinking of having a party.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, Flanders. Don't you have a neighbor on the other side?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Marge. The last time I stepped on a baseball field, I got tased.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's a problem for future Homer. Man, I don't envy that guy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey pal, howya doin'?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, let's hold hands and skip inside!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Underpants dinner!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll put a stop to this nonsense!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry Marge, I gotta call bullcrap on that. The '69 Mets will live on forever, but you think anyone cares about Ron Swoboda's wife and kids? Not me -- and, I assume, not Ron Swoboda!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boys don't have feelings, they have muscles.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"They sound good in my brain, then my tongue makes not the words sound very good, formally.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,...Then Pete Rose plowed into his friend Ray Fosse...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,...dislocating Fosse's shoulder in a meaningless game...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...He had earned the nickname ""Charlie Hustle...""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If he makes it, that's my son!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You stink!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh man, I'm never comin' down.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Another ladder!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ridin' high! Sinkin' low! Top of the heap! Down I go! On top for good! Oh, cruel hubris!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man, it's been a crazy morning. Champagne?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, charts are for squares, baby.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's my cell phone.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh baby. Let's give those seagulls something to squawk about.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah baby, I like it when you're distracted.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fine, I'll get the hook.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't fight it... That's it... That's it, a little more... How's that?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're safe now, my friend.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"O-kay, this guy's taken care of so, uh, you know...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine. I'm going for a walk.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I've had a hard trip too. One of the lenses fell out of my sunglasses.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, can I have a word with you in private?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't trust that guy. I bet he killed everyone on that boat himself.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why do pie makers get all the girls?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It was poisoned.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, it was rhubarb.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Berry-peach?! That's my favorite!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, we'd better do it quick. Because he's making scones!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"They should call this one ""recipe for murder.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Never mind.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, got a text.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, the decent thing to do is bury him at sea.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Come 'n' get it barnacles!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This proves nothing. Roger could've been the one that killed them!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then... his story was true!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey pal, how ya been?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The pie you baked us killed that shark!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We had to kill him, or he'd tell people we tried to kill him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Looks like you've got a flair for avoiding death.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, come on! Just a second...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bankers away!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I repeat: no one will ever know.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, what are you doing? That pie is poisoned!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,She just wanted to ride bikes through New England. But those seats hurt my ass!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ever wonder what she thinks about?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know, I know. Don't serve garlic... don't stab your guest in the heart with a wooden stake... don't ask him if he knows Frankenstein. It's racist somehow.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I get the drumstick!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay. If a mosquito bites you, does it become a vampire too?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay. If you bite your tongue, does it become a vampire?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man, you vamps got it made... you sleep all day...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, this place has every kind of vampire there is.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Excuse me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Have you seen these kids?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Super-Team -- fly!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hyah! Hyah!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Back off, you unholy dreamboat!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pretty ironic -- a cross being used to kill someone.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whoa, you blood-sucking freaks love your kids too?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, nobody loves his kids more than me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Come and get it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And not the good kind!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo-hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes! I can fly! See you back at the house!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nooooo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Maggie, you can't climb into the TV. If you could, I'd make Alex Trebek answer some questions.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No child of mine will go without anything, ever! Except quality healthcare!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nice part of town you got here. Too bad you keep it so far away. Now that we're best friends, can I get the baby elf?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You can't tell what's inside! Of all the times not to have x-ray vision.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll take... that one.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, this isn't the right one -- she wants the baby!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're lucky you're behind glass.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sure, it's easy to slap people when you're hidin' behind that glass!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Drive all the way... get the wrong elf... ain't no glass... I'll show 'em -- I'll buy ten more gallons of their stupid gas!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh I'm sorry, Maggie, but even at your age, I'm sure you understand things can't always go your way, and that's why... I can't believe we didn't get that stupid elf!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The march of progress.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Be sure to water the flowers on my backyard grave.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just don't dress me up like a woman.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Tell her ""no deal"".",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What is troubling you, my son? I mean, my girl son?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, if it hadn't been me, it would have been someone or something else. Sooner or later, everyone meets their ""Homer.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It may not be a boy. It could be anything: scrap-booking, high-stakes poker, or the Santa Fe lifestyle. Just pick a dead end, and chill out till you die.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that's probably because to her, the saxophone is a me, and she doesn't want to end up like you. G'night.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, she does, totally, but uh... with a happier ending. Goodnight!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nothing, sweetie, nothing! Here, let me explain.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,She does not want to... turn out like... you... didn't... not until... diplomatic... trapped... help... remember nothing!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, if you check your purse I think you'll find... the seven of clubs!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I am so sorry, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ta-da!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That would be one weird-looking kid.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I've seen that look before. That's the ""I ate the piece of wedding cake she's been saving in the freezer ten years"" look.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Run!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thank you, four-eyes!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What time Monday?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thank you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Your mom's doing laundry, but she authorized me to say goodnight for her. So, by the power vested in me, I now pronounce you sweet dreams.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look what Maggie got!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Up, a father has his secrets.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hurry up, boy. We have to burn everything the cat touched before the virus makes us paranoid.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right. We'll get the vaccine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I thought he was an old clump of rags.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why did Burns make us all come here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hell yeah!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Or helping a railroad worker grip his sledgehammer!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh man, this is great. The most evil man in town is in our power. He will do my bidding... at that fantasy football auction. And anything else my limited imagination can come up with.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, it's the golden rule: treat others the way they mess with you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now boy, everyone in town gets Burns for half an hour to do as they will.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Amen.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, Burnsie, follow the carrot!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, boy, another girder always swings in for you to walk on right when you get to the end.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where's the other girder?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Already?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, I've done all I can do in that medium.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're welcome!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And so The Bloody Hangman, his hair sticky with blood, skittered along the cobblestones, gunk dripping from his one good eye, singing his evil land chantey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"KER-SHAW, KER-SHEW / I'M AFTER YOU / WITH MY BLOODY NOOSE / STRONG ENOUGH TO HANG TEN MOOSE / KER-SHAW, KER-SHEW / IT'S JUST A STORY, BUT IT'S REALLY TRUE!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I'm no-ot! Yes I am. The Bloody Hangman walks on his stubby bone feet through the plague-ridden streets of London...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Did I? Anyway, the Bloody Hangman set to his gory work. Bodies piled up like those stackable plastic chairs.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Possibly!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The Hangman's here!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ker-shaw, ker-shew, my lies have come true!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All finished, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Flimsy? This gentle pat says different.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Is he good at tic-tac-toe like that chicken I played, lost to, and ate at the State Fair?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Way ahead of you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You can race pigeons?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmm... me, the patriarch of a bird-racing dynasty...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Danica Patrick in my thoughts!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ended that a little too soon.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What they don't suspect is that I'm into this.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid dog! Let go of that delicious bird!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on out, birdie! Follow the sound of my voice-voice-voice.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dearly beloved. I'd like to open this service with the words of Emily Dickinson: ""Hope is the thing with feathers...""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid dog!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, listen to the man -- he pays Bart's salary.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why can't you support my gibberish? I'd do it if you were stupid!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A shrink who takes kids and pets?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Even my tramp stamp?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I got the idea from a show where people regret these.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh baby! Well whaddaya know! Oh come on!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nicely done, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that's pretty sure. Subscription rate, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmm... Back yard, back yard, toilet, ocean, don't know, back yard, Flanders' mailbox, Lenny's freezer, tire fire.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Enough chitchat. Time for operation dog dump.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It was still too much.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm sure you will, because you take such good care of your ostriches.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maybe we should get going.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm watching a rerun of an important Bowl game.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I mailed them the answer but they never printed it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooo, unknown caller!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, you, gimme back my phone, and nobody gets hurt.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You said nobody gets hurt. Those were your exact words!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, Bart learned a lesson, and most important of all, we don't have to stop and pick up dinner.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maggie.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, show some respect. Three gingerbread workmen died making that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm sorry, but this leg's gonna have to go.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're gonna be okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's almost over.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now to take care of the witnesses.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm too fat to fit in a foxhole.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kids, remember when I promised to feed us from that victory garden? Well, instead I grew this tree!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You don't want a Christmas tree? That's crazy! Next you won't want a Christmas ham.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sweetie, if your mother was in trouble, they'd tell us as soon as they could.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge is Mia? Oh my God, she changed her name?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why couldn't it have been me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shut up.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whose turn is it to cry?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look at that picture!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,

Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now we just have to make it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,YOU'LL BE OH SO PLEASED / WHEN THE O.J. IS FRESHLY-SQUEEZED / AND TOAST IS MADE FROM HOMEMADE,,,,,
Homer Simpson,WE'RE GONNA GO OUT FOR BREAKFAST / WE'LL GO OUT TO EAT / IT'LL BE ANY PLACE YOU CHOOSE / AS LONG AS IT'S RUN BY JEWS / 'CAUSE THEY DON'T THINK THIS HOLIDAY'S SO GREAT.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"ALOHA'OE / ALOHA'OE... Hurry up, kids! We gotta get to the airport!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now nothing stands between us and sunny Hawa...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ai-yi-yi-yi!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I got the week off by telling Mr. Burns I had a neck injury!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Burns, why'd you come to see me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... uh...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Coming!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fine, I'll come clean.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, it's not. I just told a lie so we could go to Hawaii.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, jus' one more drink, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sweetie, relax. Let's just watch some TV.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh? What'd I do?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fifty bucks?! That used to cover two public nudities and a poop in the park!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the hell?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, Lou. Gimme a break!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Since when is all this against the law?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is supposed to be the happiest day of my life and it's ruined.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I get it. The government runs out of money, so they pass a bunch of lame-o laws to sock it to the little guy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's almost a thousand dollars!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ten minutes? I can't wait that long! I left an ice cream cone in my cup holder!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Chief, this is just a big misunderstanding. I meant to write ""bride."" It's a wedding present.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My bribe!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's okay, it's okay. I can be out in eighteen months with good behavior.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't tell me I'm not capable of good behavior!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Your honor, I would like to request a sidebar.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All that time I'll be stuck in my cell, unable to exercise...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I repeat: unable to exercise...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What? This guy?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't go undercover with Fat Tony. He's met me. I've been in his house. I was briefly his Consiglieri... Consugly... Canolli... Robert Duvall.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can I be Johnny Undercover?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, Melvin Mafia.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can I keep the name after I'm done?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ayyyy! Ohhhh! Ayyyy! Ohhhh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fuhgetaboutit!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, what's my name again?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, I'm comin'.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'd like a third helping, please.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just get the ladle down there deep -- that's where the beaks are!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you're that guy from the F.B.--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,There was barbecue sauce on it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I haven't earned his trust if it's based on a lie.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's a dime store?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Blue pants power!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Beating? What beating?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh. That beating.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can I have any of the steaks?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's so mean!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Please! Let me have it! Come on! Give it to me right in the mouth!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well... back in my keister you go.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How're you gonna do that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll take care of this.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oregano, basil, rosemary...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, boss.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah. Those guys are probably FBI informants.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah. I got in your gang and you barely know who I am.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What are we doing here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I guess I could tell him he could improve his phone etiquette.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh no! No! I... was uh... just thinking how cheap this crime would have been in the seventies when gas was thirty-five cents a gallon.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is horrible! I keep smelling my own breath!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My neck is kind of itchy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Tony, you've gotta get outta here -- now!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't ask questions! Just go!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ayyyy!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ayyyy!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ohhhh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ayyyy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ohhhh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No! You're wrong! Check again!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So that's it! You used me to kill a man, and all I get is a handshake and a blanket?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Poor Tony. He didn't deserve this. He was just a soldier in a war he started.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's not over, Marge. It'll never be over. When I shut my eyes, all I see is Fat Tony and me having drinks at that bar on the beach.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh. Well, uh... you wouldn't like it. It's not very good.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no, I oversold it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'd give anything to bring you back.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fat Tony?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, I've never seen a mobster use a tracksuit for exercising.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I understand. I loved him too.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Do what you gotta do. The quicker you kill me up here, the quicker he can kill me down there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I worked for Fat Tony. And he was the best boss I ever had.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wha-- oh, oh, uh, Mr. Burns? Uh, you were cool too.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,He took me to a fight that he fixed. But he never let on. Not even when I bet five hundred dollars on the wrong guy. Then he said he would dope a horse for me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you gonna kill me now? 'Cause I'm super ready.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, the killers have been kind to me... while the people who were supposed to protect me treated me like dirt! What kind of a world is this?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And your enemies closer?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fit Tony took his cousin's place running the Springfield mob.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The pressures got to him so he started to eat. Soon, he was known as ""Fit Fat Tony,"" then just ""Fat Tony"" for short.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And me? Now, I'm just an average shnook like everyone else.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stuck in this backwater burg where all you can count on is your family. And the only one who ever shot anyone is the baby.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And I have to admit, it's a pretty good life.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can't start the day without that fresh-from-the-circus feeling.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you through with the chair? I've got to do the taxes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay let's see, number of dependents: three. Um, add to line thirteen...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hm, better check last year's return.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hm.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Been a while since our wives got together, huh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, I got a text!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you gonna open it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Because you're my best friend in the room.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Anyone see a good beer commercial lately?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sure, I'll stay home and Skype with the guys at Moe's.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid Flanders' wi-fi!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ion. Hmm... No. ""Irene Ryan is TV's Granny.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is late for Marge. I assume. I've never been home at this hour.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Marge. Partaking of the grape, were we?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Great. That's great. But I have to get to work in the morning.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's kind of weird, us all being naked in here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Right... neither am I.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, three!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I've put it off, but today I'm finally getting this garage organized--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Guess I'll put these tools away. Put 'em on hooks and stuff.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can we at least drink beer or something?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you beautiful man.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,God you're hilarious.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't like those guys.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh no. I left a candy bar in my desk.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Time to punch in.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A dinosaur!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He's washing his hands.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute! Your standard markup is four hundred percent?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Check out my tolerance, Marge. I'm going to use the men's room.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I didn't know you were... uh... you know, one of those--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But you do like comic books.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ah! Got one!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Everyone in that live studio audience is dead now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, mash the buttons till something good comes on.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Life was so much easier when a machine told you when to laugh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I liked the producing, the executive producing and especially the co-producing. But the supervising producing was the best I've ever seen.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, son, if I bought you that bike, you wouldn't appreciate it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Because when you get anything you want, you don't want anything you get.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Someday you'll understand that I'm just being a good dad.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little!!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hm. I never thought of fatherhood as something that could affect a kid.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, I won't strangle you anymore, but I also won't get you that mini-bike.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wish I could, son. I really wish I could.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart's mad because he wanted me to buy him something but I didn't think it was the right thing to do.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, not in front of the refrigerator.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well in that case, Lisa was using her solar calculator yesterday so I opened the drapes to let in more sun.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, in season two, when Sam got good grades, he got a very surprising reward.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And if you do it, son, you'll get the same.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's great.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, you already have your reward... the feeling of accomplishment you can only get from hard work.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, if they care that much about whether you have a mini-bike, then they weren't really your friends.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmm, if this were a TV show that would be a helluva act break.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But it could use a button. Oh, what if I said... Well if you...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You still see that crow on shows sometimes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Apu.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can't lose that. It's the best picture of me I have.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, I do know a lot about nuclears.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, would you like a ""Thicker Than Waters"" collectible plate?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah? I'll show you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""TV Guide Offer, One World Trade Center...""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Awww...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And I love having you here, son. 'Cause you can wake me up if somebody comes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Check this out, Bart. One of those retinal scan dealies. It only opens to my eye or an exact copy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let's see if this works.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Damn, that hurt!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll just use my eye.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Because you've been such a great kid lately and I wanted to show you I appreciated it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmm, the boy's acting really weird. I did everything that TV show told me to and he's still not happy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where is he going?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why on earth would a child go to the zoo...?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Step away from the traitor!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The boy's flash drive may be in there. But I've got a lifetime of nuclear secrets up here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I know what you're saying! I understand food talk in every language!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Um... I'll see myself out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, who can take me to the airport for less than twenty dollars? I can stand here all day.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My feet hurt.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, now it's time for the best kind of bonding -- sitting next to each other in silence, staring blankly at the TV.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"CHERISH THAT FAMILY SMILE / PICKET FENCE DAYS GO SOMETHING SOMETHING / THE FUTURE IS COMING SOON / MOM AND DAD AND KIDS ARE SOMMMMETHING That's my favorite song now. Sorry ""Don't Fear the Reaper."" Everybody! Air guitar! Come on, do it with me! Use your whammy bar! Whew! Now fuzz it up! Excellent!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now all you need are customers. Well, better get home to the little woman.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do you have plans for tonight?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, thank you, prior obligation!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Drive my kids to school?! Never!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid double snuggler's hitch! Only hope is to chew off my leg.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ow! Ow! Huh, mmm, not bad. Just a hundred and twenty-seven more hours.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Marge, don't worry, a lot of movie stars have gray hair, like all those women we loved in the eighties.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, it's not easy with you talking all the time.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So... chicken.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sweetie, you've always been beautiful, but now you're my silver belle. Let me get the camera we use for precious moments and insurance claims.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What has she done?! I feel like I'm married to Richard Gere!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I can't talk now, I'm talking to myself! No, no, Homer, go ahead. Thanks, Homer, it'll just be a minute. What's up?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So basically, my job is to make you look good by comparison. Like West Virginia does for Virginia.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The good doctor has just the prescription.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You ever notice that pizzas have gotten so small lately?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, that's exactly it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh I know.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So Lenny, ever get that rebar out of your head?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I don't know... it's a lot of work.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Deal!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I do keep it together.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh. Usually when it gets this quiet Mr. Burns is standing behind me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge? What are you doing here? This bar is for singles and wingmen only.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, Marge, put down that broom. You've got nothing to be afraid of from them. I'm a wingman. Part of a great tradition including Val Kilmer from ""Top Gun,"" Wedge Antilles from ""Star Wars,"" and me, from now. And you know why I'm a great wingman? Because I have the confidence that comes from knowing I get to go home to you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And you know what else this whole experience has taught me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Probably.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I guess I do have a ""type.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Is my job creating power, empowering?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Only my hairdresser knows for sure.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He's dying in a retirement home. Now kiss me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait! I haven't chosen my mix-in!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay... I'll take some of... that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mix it in.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's it, boy! I'm eating your yogurt!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,He didn't know that!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid kid. All you do is cost me money. Money I could be wasting!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wealthy? Hey, remember the guy who drove you to school that one time. Eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, what brings you here, Mr. Chair?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I legally forced him to say ""semi"".",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My little Roman Polanski!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?! What's wrong with being Roman Polanski?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He what?...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You monster!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Observe.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Soda?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,More for me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It would be an honor!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There's something going on at the nuclear plant that's a little more important that your ""table read.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Family, today I graduate from my anger management class.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pained noises.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh okay, uh, Lenny, hit me with that chair.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't feel bad, boy. Everyone makes mistakes. Yours is just public and expensive.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I have many people to thank...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Angry Dad's voice is part Walter Matthau... Hey, Felix!... part Little Richard Whoooo! ...and a little bit of Snoopy when he cries.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'd like to thank Mr. Speedy Pants Repair for sewing up my pants just before the ceremony...and the woman who has inspired me everyday for the past twenty-five years... the cute one from the Bangles. See you at the cool party!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey! Don't you know it's awards season? Who's calling you at five in the morning anyway?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If I find out it's a right number, you're in big trouble.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oscars? What are you talking about? My son gave me this list of awesome things to do in L.A.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmm... Who could possibly want to stop me from accepting an award?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I was born a Rollin' Eighty, and I'll die a Rollin' Eighty.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You got your wish, boy. I'm proud of ya. I'm sorry I took all the credit.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, they're like five bucks on eBay.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, hi! Ricky Gervais, umm such an honor to meet you, Sir Ridley. I love your movies. Or as I call them, ""films."" Umm, glad I bumped into you, actually. Because, uh, I'm looking to expand beyond comedy. I know what you're thinking, Sir Ridley. You're thinking ""Oh my word, he's been making me laugh all these years, but now he's moving me as well. I'm gonna have to put him in my new film. What do you think?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm a seat filler.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well why couldn't you have said that a minute ago? Don't take any of my ideas.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Me! Me! I want him every night, and forever and ever! 'Cause I love my--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's great, honey. If you were a boy, you'd be a scientist.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmm, if it works on nasty scorpions, then maybe... it'll work on nasty stains!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It does!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And there's something else it might be good for.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why are you guys eating so fast?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, you look tense. Let's discuss this over a cup of Grampa's coffee.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Your kisses feel like raw liver.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, come on, make with the laffy juice! I wanna take Grampa to have his bellybutton pierced.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, because Lisa won't tell me what flower it's from.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah. But Lisa won't tell me how to make it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nerd.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh? This one didn't make me feel anything.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thank you for the tour of your factory, Mister Wonka.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Go ahead.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's what I was gonna call it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah -- we better ""grump it up.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Your grandfather is not a monster.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, let's chain him in the basement until the circus gets to town.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It better be tonsillitis.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, I guess we're all in the same boat, huh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Walther, let's not be so hasty. Who would begrudge them a few years of shambling, dope-fogged, into the grave? Besides, our generation's got everything under control! Now, if you'll excuse me, I was supposed to be drunk an hour ago. To Moe's!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Flat tire? No problem!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Great idea, but I don't have any money.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I wouldn't have to pay it back for three more years! What are the odds of that much time happening?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Problem solved. Generation awesome does it again!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Their ""can-do"" will bail out our ""won't-try"" every time!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cheech and Chong are coming back to Springfield?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, Cheech and Chong were the Beavis and Butthead of their day!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've failed as a parent. I swore the day my son was born he would appreciate stoner comedy. To the media room!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He's flushing his pot down the toilet unnecessarily!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Back then we'd play these albums again and again till they were filled with skips and clicks and pops. Which was about three times.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hide the dope!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then what did I just smoke?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I thought they'd do bits -- but their most famous bit?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooo, he's gonna say ""Dave's not here!""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dave's not here! Dave's not here!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh no! Chong is refusing to fall back on his old catch-phrases.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't do reefer comedy -- I'm drunk. Two different animals.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dave's not here, man!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dave?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dave's not here, man!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll give Dave your message.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My time being wasted was not wasted!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes! Will I get to meet Dave?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How 'bout Don Johnson?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It is so cool for you to let me go on tour with Cheech.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sweetie, don't worry. I'm gonna come back so horny and angry...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't believe I'm riding around in Cheech's van! The van made of weed!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh. What's it made of? Hash? Shrooms? Lysergic acid diethylamide?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, Cheech. I know all the classic bits of you and Chong.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can we get high from the fumes?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,CHEECH AND CHONG HAS LOST ITS CHONG / I AM THE CHONG NOW... TAKE A LITTLE LOOK / TAKE A LITTLE LOOK / TAKE A LITTLE LOOK AT ME-E...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah, I getcha -- ""work on the show."" Maybe we should start at four-twenty, right? Marijuana reference!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hard work? I thought this was gonna be fun.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,CHEECH IS SURE A LOT LESS COOL / THAN I IMAGINED...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,BETTER SHUT UP / CHEECH IS REALLY MAD / I WISH THAT I HAD GONE WITH CHO-ONG...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah, a reward from Cheech!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmm?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why aren't you exactly like your stage persona?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Eurocentric! When do we have wacky adventures?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can we at least get some French fries?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stop speaking Spanish!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's disrespectful to the high standards people have come to expect from Cheech and Chunk.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, sir.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Tour bus parked. Gotta save Marge!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, sweetie, do you know how low, low prices are ""insane?"" Well, sometimes people can be too.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't look back, Marge. Don't look back.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let's just leave the crazy woman alone in our house. We've got something more important to attend to.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We'll deal with all that later.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, if Art Garfunkle could forgive that untalented twerp Paul Simon, you can do this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Tell him how you feel.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, surrender to the moment! Don't make the mistake I always do of thinking too much before you act!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hold on, lemme get the door here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who are you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, okay, wait, let's start again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll be out here with you, Dave.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay. I'll go get some stuff.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Way down here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Gee, sorry, Dave.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey! Mr. Burns needs our help!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Looks like it's up to me. Let's see, target at two o'clock... adjust for wind ...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I haven't finished my rituals yet!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All your money and all your stuff.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, Super Bowl tickets?... playoff tickets?... regular season, bobble-head day?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, this has been great. We should get home soon -- the game's going to be starting.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that's right! I hope you kids are enjoying yourselves today, because you and your children will be paying for this place long after the team moves to another city.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"EVERYBODY DANCE NOW! DO, DO, DO, DO / DO, DO, DO, DO...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, party pooper -- bust a move!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, come on, sourpuss. Tickle tickle!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Tickle tickle too!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Tickle-tickle-who-wants-a-pickle!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, he's laughing, that means he's happy. Has the Joker taught you nothing?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, I'm really, really sorry.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I don't know if I can... whoo!... ever make it up to you. I-- whoo!... but I sincerely whoo!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No one else is doing it. I'm trying to start it. Whoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart's never gonna forgive me for humiliating him.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, it was your idea to give him self-esteem in the first place!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now I have to work overtime--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,--just to counteract the self-confidence--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well of course, I would love to be a more sensitive father. You know that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'd like to see you thumb through an extension school catalogue and find one.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Please, Marge, no! The other negligent dads'll make fun of me! They're so cliquey!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I miss my friends from drunk driving school. They were so cool.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, for one thing, you're never really ready to be a father. But, oh, you know, the other day, Bart, the little dickens, said I had an elephant butt. So anyway, I'm strangling him, and I said to Bart...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, strangling. I mean, it's not the only tool in my parenting toolbox, but it's the sharpest! Right? Anyway, I said ""Bart""...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I guess it's just how I was raised.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So... are those butter cookies for everybody, or...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who do you have next period?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Doc. Where is everybody?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why didn't you tell me not to come?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wha-wha-what are you doing?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No Doc, please! I'm just a little boy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dr. Zander, you made me see my life through Bart's neck, and I swear, I will never, ever strangle my boy again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um, I uh, lied about having health insurance.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I want you to know I'm cured.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh son, I can't quit drinking any more than I could quit being a man.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now it feels like morning. What I am cured of is the blind rage that has soured our otherwise storybook relationship.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Go ahead -- just try to provoke me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh come on, bust your daddy's chops.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll teach you to...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you... I'm gonna... Maybe this time...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can't hurt the boy. Can't hurt the boy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, get down from there!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh c'mon, now you're a tree?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"How many more, sir?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,These are my keys.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I-I said my keys-ter is ready for a whooping, sir.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no. I'm just a kid. Leave me alone!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's ""A-B-C-1-2-3""! It's the easiest song in the world!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that's ridiculous. How could two people from the same family need therapy?",,,,,

Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, you and I are gonna be closer than ever as we spend the rest of our lives suing that therapist.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Pretty sweet, eh boy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not bad, not bad. Marge, how much do they pay us for doing this?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What the? First we work, then I pay, then I have to eat fruit? Why was I ever born?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Honey... on a non-stone fruit-related topic, I booked us a couples massage.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"When we get home, the peaches will be gone.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Masseuses: the half-doctors, half-hookers who solve everything.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My ear makes money?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, boat store? I'd like to order a boat. What do you mean, dial tone?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let's see what else you've been hiding in there.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I want my pot of gold!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I forgot why I'm doing this.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, don't feel bad. Judas betrayed Jesus but he still got paid.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't stand to see one of my female children unhappy. I'm gonna go pound some sense into that ring-linking rabbit-yanker!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, let me down! This is gonna leave a diamond pattern on my skin!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, maybe secrets are a big deal, but my daughter's a good kid. So why don't you act your age, forgive her and let me down.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll save you, Lisa!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The real magic is raising three kids in this economy! You can put the ball back now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And, here you go. ""Do not give your coat to--"" Dammit!",,,,,

Homer Simpson,Oh my God!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You are cruel but fair.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm trying. I swear I'm trying.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dammit!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes! I'm so happy I lived to see this day! He did give her the kiss of death, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I decorated her car for nothing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lousy Saint Louis Cardinals. Can't win the nineteen eighty-five World Series on Classic Sports.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fat Tony! Are you gonna cut my head off and leave it in a manger scene at Christmas? And then an old Italian nun finds it. And she's all... No, no, no, oh, no, no! He's too beautiful to die! Ohhhh!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hm. So, should I bring a towel?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um, I take a special size.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, Bart. We've been out here for hours.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maybe we've found all the truffles. The only thing I've dug up was these weird-looking mushrooms.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll dispose of those for you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, that's his thing. Anyway, Fat Tony and I think this is a chance to patch things up between you and Selma. Plus it's a free weekend at the beach.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Selma? Va-va-va-wha?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, if you insist.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You are such a gentle kisser.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,HEY!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wouldn't they be girls?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You know -- it had that painting of that lady and the monster on the ceiling.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He's cheating on Selma? That's crazy! Why go out for a hamburger when you've got rancid steak at home?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll just sit here quietly.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How could Tony cheat on me so soon?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Y'know Selma, from what I've seen here, Fat Tony has a lot of bad influences on him. I walked though a door last night and they were playing cards for real money.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, can't we stay one more day? The Occurrence and I are going to the tanning salon and get oiled and broiled.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't wanna be ""that guy,"" but Marge is making me be ""that guy.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's a wife ring? Marge, don't look!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You were right, Marge. These people are not for us.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Which is lucky for me because you're always right.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I get to enjoy this, but I'm not responsible.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Actually, Dad, as the supervising parent today, you'll get your share of the blame, too.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What do I do? Patty's gonna kill me! Unless... I kill her first! I put the body in the car, I dump the car in the lake, I put a James Taylor CD in the stereo so they think it's a suicide...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fine, whatever.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll just keep cutting till I hit something solid.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And now, to break the news as gently as I know how.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wake-up-and-look-at-your-hair!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What happened to you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who undid my do?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's just what I was going for! I was going for Scary.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You did this?! With your fat fingers and your brain the size of a super ball?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And stay out!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lady, I'm not a hairdresser -- I just put a new lid on a couple of trashcans.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A hundred dollars?! Marge, how much is that in smackaroos?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I open a lot of crazy things when I'm drunk, but I don't think so.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just call me ""Homer Fingerhands.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, when someone loses their hair, they miss it the most. It's like a beloved dog that died on your head.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now that my soft, chestnut mane is gone, I dream of cutting hair, styling hair, making hair shorter in exchange for money... maybe I should open a hair salon.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah. But what if I can't find any commercial rental property?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh now, how could someone as young as you know about twenty years ago?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm sorry, honey. All day long I have to listen to women talk.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not a good time.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah. Men are such dogs, and vice versa.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is there anyone in here that just wants a haircut with no chitchat?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,These are really good scissors.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All day long they tell me stupid, pointless, boring stories, and I have to stand there listening with a phony grin plastered on my face.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,When I look at you -- all I see are the foibles that drive your women crazy! Foibles! Foibles! FOIBLES!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry Sarah, I'm retired.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'd like to see you try.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Excuse me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Come on! Would you--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, bro, don't hassle me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stop that. Okay, okay. You win. I'll teach you how to make love to your wife!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Right.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I can't. They won't let me. Lenny, be a pal and saw off my hands.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Suck! Of course!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my God. Like Mozart and Johnny Knoxville, my genius cannot be stopped!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,There's only one way out -- I'm committing Barbicide!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why doesn't anything kill me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, do you hear it? Listen! It's the hair -- growing! Always growing! Blonde, brunette... auburn!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm afraid it's all too true. My wife has betrayed me... with another hairdresser!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Another hairdresser?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw sweetie, thanks for saving me from the horrible life Warren Beatty lived in ""Shampoo."" And now it's time to pay you back...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,As long as it doesn't involve losing weight or changing my pants.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I love your low prices, but why did these weddings get cancelled?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Awww...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And these keys are from all my jobs.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Cake, will you do me the honor of making my stomach the happiest bag of acid in the world? You will?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Time for a shortcut.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh-oh, they've got the right-of-way.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Morning.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who's alone in the vehicle?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, first the good news... two of your kids are not locked in the car.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maggie!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, if you live long enough you start to accumulate things. This is from a gas station men's room. They put the block of wood on it so you don't walk away with it. These are from a key party we went to before we realized what a key party was--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stop who, Marge? Be specific.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, it might have been the time when...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Or maybe I just found them on the ground.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my God... there's the fire brewer... the beechwood ager... the rat filter...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The Duff blimp! Oh, how I'd love to drive that thing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Really, Duff blimp? You really want me to?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, what the hell? Life is made to be lived. I've been buttoned down too long!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,When we see each other again you'll be an old man and I'll be a baby!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hm. Is it drinking and driving if you're flying a blimp? Maybe I can find the answer by texting.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yo, Lenny... ...do you know anything about... flying the blimp while drinking...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What was that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So long, suckers!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, kids!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,If I tossed you guys a bucket full of something could you pour it out and toss the bucket back up? Don't drink it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But there's so many buttons!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, take the controls!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Blimp Assassin Three.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Xbox.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fly the blimp, you spoiled kid!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll save you, honey!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Boy! Stomp on my head!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're a real jerrrk!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you undead little...!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That doesn't mean you're any better than him, young lady. He could be a war hero.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,All pooted out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's worse than you think. I have to buy you a new anniversary present.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Little help...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But you learned! You grew!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I thought I was.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Awww...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Little help... little help... Flanders, little help?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, absolutely, Ned. Sorry.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Little help...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, sweetie. Daddy will put Jack back in the box.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, time to go back in the... night-night... This is harder than it looks... don't you humiliate me in front of my kid... I thought we had a deal, man!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, if it isn't the local school marm... and his new girlfriend. That's a burn on you, Flanders.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whoa! Flanders, this chick does not get our thing!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, language.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, tell her how I don't push Ned around.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Ned, can I borrow some hair?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't panic, son. We can bust up Teachy and Preachy. Here's what we do: I'll take Flanders out and remind him of the joys of the single life. You scare Rod and Todd by telling them Krabappel will become their evil stepmother.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just the opposite of real life.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, isn't this place great? If you're single you can come here every night.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ned, let's cut to the chase.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ned, if it's boneheaded to talk you outta seein' Edna, then I don't wanna be brainheaded.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Ned, I never dreamed that beneath those iddilies and diddilies there was a dude.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you beautiful, beautiful wuss.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ned, I have a confession to make: I may not have come here solely with the noble intention of getting drunk. But now, from the bottom of my heart, I wish you and Edna the best.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fellow barflies! To Ned Flanders and Edna Krabappel!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shut up.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Guys, quit telling the truth!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um... uh... So uh, Joey, is Wikipedia accurate when it says ""Walk This Way"" was inspired by ""Young Frankenstein?""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't you mean ""neighboreeno?""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You stupid jerks! I can't believe you could be so cruel! Especially you, Joey Kramer!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I've got some bad news for you, Marge. I'm actually not.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wha? My doctor said ""don't walk.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Flanders, hold up!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know, I know you're not comfortable with all the guys Edna's seen around town.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ned, I've learned that the only way a relationship survives is by forgiving! Endless, endless forgiving!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And didn't the Easter bunny himself say ""forgive them, father, for finding all my eggs?"" And if a giant rabbit can lay chocolate eggs, maybe you and Edna can find a way to make it work.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There's a whole host of voting options -- friends with benefits, frenemies with frenefits, super friends with wonder pets, all designed to distract you while we take your personal information and use it to apply for credit cards in your name.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Right. Teasing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm waitin' for ya.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Also, if you wanna find the real shooter of Mr. Burns, go back and look for more clues. They're all there!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, right. A baby shot a guy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,QUIET STEPS ARE WHAT I TAKE / SNEAKING IN AT NOON...,,,,,

Homer Simpson,DUCK IN THE BATHROOM.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'M STILL DRUNK FROM LAST NIGHT, / GOT DRIVEN HOME, I DON'T KNOW BY WHOM.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"SOME MAY SAY / I DON'T DESERVE ANY PAY, BUT HEY / I CAME UP WITH ""SIXTIES DAY""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,LAST MAY!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"While I'm here, I might as well pre-punch out...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hm, we've had a lot of bills lately. Better put in some overtime.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Larry, my man!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you're not Larry. How come you're not Larry?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, listen, if you could indulge me... Larry and I fist-bump every morning. Like that...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The warmth of human contact with a manly whiff of violence.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wha?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sheez!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Maybe I was a little hard on him, expecting him to be Larry right away. By the way, where is Larry?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Good ol' Larry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Say... Wayne, I couldn't help but notice that your breath doesn't smell like alcohol. You want to go grab a beer after work?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, maybe he just doesn't like fist-bumping.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"As God as my witness, this fist will be bumped.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, a guy at work seems not to like me. I guess it's not much when you look at real problems in the world like major league umpires not using instant replay.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I love you so much! Potatoes and gravy on the side, please.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Charlie, wanna grab a beer?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh. Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wayne!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Want a ride?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, I just got a little chill when you said my name.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, I'm not weird or anything, I just like to feel like I'm friends with everybody.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But what if the weathergirl--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Men's room? Oh my god! We're completing each other's...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Completing each other's... sen... ten... cesss...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wayne?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wayne, maybe it's the me being still alive talking, but I think you're awesome.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh c'mon, stay for dessert!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sure. Why not.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's best to concentrate on what you do have.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wayne, stop! That's Mr. Burns.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why don't you come stay with us till you can get back on your feet?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Of course. I mean, how long could it be?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's funny, because I have recurring flash-forwards to a nightmarish future.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That robot took our jobs!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He said it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Or maybe it was him.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man, this robot really gets me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Your voice is so gravelly, just like Lauren Bacall's.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Neh, they couldn't find a Google map photo without me naked or urinating.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not the one you're thinking of, there's another one.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,WASHIN' OUT THE DOG POO / SURE BEATS PICKIN' IT UP / FLANDERS' DRIVEWAY IS MY GOAL...,,,,,

Homer Simpson,Except me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I suppose if the friend was being horribly tortured...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey! Wha?! Wha?! Wha?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, not the middle seat!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Death to America!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine. I am being held somewhere in the Springfield area. Turn the card.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What will you guys use when there aren't newspapers anymore?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, well way to make me feel obsolete.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh look, here's a coupon for scissors that you have to cut out. Think, geniuses.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, hey! What are you doing?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is no way to treat the talent!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cold. So cold.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So cold. Warm me up.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just let me put my hands under your armpits.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So much violence on the surface world. I'm going back.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cold. So cold.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aww, that's what I call closure!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They always come up with such catchy ways to make us pay for things we don't need for kids we didn't want.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't want people to know my kids go to this lousy school.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't buy it! I bought one last year and it was crap construction!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Paddles down! It's the only way to change the system!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why of course! Even if I don't have a legal obligation to pay, it's clearly the right thing to do.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here's one thousand dollars... two thousand dollars... three thousand dollars... Ooh, I need more cash. Better go to my invisible ATM.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What? Two dollar charge for non-network bank?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, I wanna ask you about something I read in a magazine. Are you boys cyberbullying each other?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I parented!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Later, losers.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, your mother thinks there's something suspicious about all you boys having a meeting in this treehouse.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, my ice cream's melting and I haven't finished my brownie!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You guys need to get a woman.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you covering me up?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The least I can get out of this whole nightmare is some face time on the local news. It's kind of my way of sending a Christmas card. Happy Holidays, everyone! Family's fine!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm fine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay... I'm on the floor... I can't move... so far a normal Sunday morning.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is so horrible -- I can't speak...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"How did this happen? Last thing I remember, I was decorating the house for Halloween.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, Halloween. The one time of year when the squalor of our home works to our advantage.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where's that spider?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Squeeze, squeeze... squeeze, squeeze. A real spider would get so mad if I did this! I wonder if this thing has batteries.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's alive?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, at least I still look good.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge. This is the purest love there is: patient, supportive... ooh, cleavage!",,,,,

Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh man, what's this bite gonna do? My wrists are tingling... I feel new powers surging within me...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...I want you to find out what's making that funny noise in Homer Simpson's car. It's, uhhh, you know, it's like a chigga-chigga-chigga-chigga. But you only hear it when you're driving over thirty. And you never hear it when you take it to the shop.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You forgot Patty and Selma. Oh, wait. That hasn't happened yet.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, how would that work?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, Stupid Flanders, first I want you to kill that guy at the ice cream parlor who gave Homer Simpson a cone that had a little air in it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Come on! God does crazy things! Check your Old Testament.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Bart... I mean, Jesus. Hey son, you want Flanders to kill anybody? He's totally in my power.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I sayeth unto you... slay every tall boy in town!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, and what are you gonna do about it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Language.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little!... /,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""In the event of a primary core breach, you have fifteen seconds to avoid a complete--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A woman of stature!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Assistant? Well, I have been pretty overworked lately.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I guess I should find out a little bit about you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So your dad has money to lend?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is where we get our coffee. Just leave a little at the bottom so someone else has to make the next pot. The burning smell will let them know.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh-oh, it's Old man Burns!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, Young man Burns.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That sucker soaks up flattery like a Twinkie soaks up gravy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh well!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thy will be done, Lord Vader. Please don't hurt me. Please.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Awww...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, get my seal club! The big one!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Life imitates Flart.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hm.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why would a Homer Humiliator do this to me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Y'ello. Hey, Barney... a free movie screening? Of course I can go! I just need somebody to hold down the fort.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, uh, Roz, I have to step out for one hour and forty-three minutes. Could you cover for me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Woo hoo! Oh, uh, if an emergency alarm goes off, there's earplugs in the top drawer!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I thought of it first.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I just saw the greatest movie. Guess what happens when a mop is replaced with an octopus! I'll give you a clue, it's funny!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Someone snitched? Wha-wha-wha-wha-what are you gonna do to me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Up or down?,,,,,

Homer Simpson,Am I early?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Since I got demoted I have to show my I.D., but the picture was taken so long ago I put on a lot of weight, so I have to stretch out my face and say ""I used to look like this...""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're mean!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can one of the hundred be making the list?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can some of them be callbacks to earlier ones?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Do this, do that. Lousy Roz, thinks she's so big...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm having problems with my new boss Roz. She's the most evil person to come out of Ohio since LeBron, but at least he thought long and hard before screwing everybody over, in public for no reason.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is this her?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,C'mon. The apple must be wreaking havoc with the Twinkie!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Are you aware that ""stones"" means ""man junk?""",,,,,

Homer Simpson,And check these out...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is there any better feeling than cutting in line because a plastic badge says you're special?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, video games sure have changed since I was a kid. How many points does it take to get an extra life these days, son? Thirty thousand? Certainly not fifty.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I won't shed a tear when the oceans rise and wash this world away.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man, how many quarters does this game take?",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"That's good, Marge -- get all the terrible ideas out of your system.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Here's what I do: pick the thing that Marge would hate the most...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, the kids are acting ethnic!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh no, I don't eat anything new unless I've eaten it before!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't want to think about food, I want to like it. Why drive across town to ""savor"" a bowl of mystery mush when there's four different Krustyburgers we can see from our house?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, and here's my favorite restaurant: ""la fridge!"" It's open twenty-four hours a day and there's no dress code!",,,,,

Homer Simpson,And I've got tickets for the grand opening Saturday night!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Pine needle... sorbet... Pine needle sorbet!! My kids do not eat sorbet, they eat sherbet, and they pronounce it ""sherbert"" and they wish it was ice cream!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fine. Blow off ""Fun Dad,"" go eat your walrus mustaches and deep-fried pixie wangs.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Jealous? Me?! That is to laugh! The very idea... if anything you're the one who's jealous!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Of how much fun I am to be around! It's always a party with Fun Dad!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Too sad to walk! Too sad and fun to walk...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"When I'm sad, I make baseball bats.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really? You'd let me in on your thing? Even though I think it's stupid?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hand me that saw, Marge!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"When I'm happy, I make birdhouses!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Kids! Guess what? Mom invited me to your fancy dinner!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I guess Fun Dad is a foodie now!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Food Dad! Food Dad! Food Dad!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fun Dad is a foodie now!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is my thing and always will be!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fun me... fun me... fun me...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, I'm pretty excited about this far-out dinner. Maybe I'll like it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, actually, I've come around on hipsters. Takes a lot of guts to all wear the same hat.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So it's weird -- don't worry, I'll make it fun.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"East Oak Street, is that it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Here it is: 1501 East Oak. No name on the door -- very trendy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is this the chemical kitchen place where you do the crazy cooking?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The experience begins!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just like Marge said -- chemicals and test tubes. The open kitchen is a nice touch.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I guess I'll get started before my family gets here. How much for a taste, you know, just to get me going?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ouch, this place is fancy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hipsters... Too cool for school...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, my wife thinks it's too crazy for me, but I'm gonna prove her wrong.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm doing this for my family!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This better be dinner theater!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge! This isn't a food restaurant! It's a meth restaurant! A meth-taurant!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now that's my kind of foam.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here's fifty bucks. For the next two hours, I don't want to know you exist.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Family fun day.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ex-tinct!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We're not here for you, we're here for Lenny.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, why should the asteroid have all the fun?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, you can each have one toy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, that's it! Forget it! No toys for anyone!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay -- Maggie gets a toy!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've waited my whole life to hear that!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So tired... go on without me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's not against the law to sleep in a Tyrannosaurus head!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I demand to speak to my paleontologist!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A million bucks?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I know five idiots!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The perfect crime, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A million bucks has changed stupider minds than yours.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We're taking down kids who read.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm putting together a tween-lit gang-write.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Tween-lit gang-write. But this Babar needs a Zephyr.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're the Zephyr.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It won't be like Kansas City.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on beautiful, I can't do the job without you, so what do you say?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The caper is writing a kids' fantasy novel.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do you have a computer?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're in.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Relax, with the team we put together, our book'll fly off the shelves, and we'll be sipping mai tais on a beach in Shelbyville.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait, you're gonna be all the guys? How would that work?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, our book will be about... an orphan who goes to a magical school... where he discovers he's... a vampire!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The king of fantasy books on our fantasy book-writing team?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But why?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I just hope we put in enough steampunk, whatever that is.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, only your professional-strength output tray can handle the weight of our manuscript.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo-hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We know, we wrote it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stupid, stupid, stupid! We forgot to create a fake author!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Or... your name could be on a book in ten minutes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Gentlemen! To ""The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy!""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, does this square us for Kansas City?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"How could the publishers change our book? If they had been in charge of the Sistine Chapel, the whole thing would be vampires -- instead of the pope's private naked dude mural!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But the trolls were the best part! Do the characters still say ""troll-y"" instead of ""cool?""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that is so untroll-y!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,British Fonzie is right. Our story is actually more important... than money.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Somewhere in that building is a computer with their sucky version of our masterpiece.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Kansas City.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo-hoo! All right!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, we may have lost, but we gave the bad guy a laugh -- that's something.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you wouldn't say that... unless there was a need to thank you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You switched the drives?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So... why are you here? Is it about that unauthorized Krusty lookalike I hired for Lisa's first communion? What was his name?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This party is so much better than the crummy ones we plan.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Burns, so glad you're here! Finally the party can get started!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good one... uh... Mr. Burns, everyone is dying to hear you sing karaoke.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, just pick a popular song.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just play the oldest, stupidest thing in your catalog.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,GOING UP SHE GOES! UP SHE GOES!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...So he says, ""Bigamy is having one too many wives."" To which I replied, ""So's monogamy.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's never good. I always wind up being chased by hounds, or falling through a trap door...or being a peg in your game of human croquet...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The last thing I understood in that was ""pants.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, in that case...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! No more church!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So long, Sector 7-G...hello, Sector 22-F!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, you're kind of a downer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I thought you were retiring. Why are you still here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh-oh, a meeting with the Mayor. How do I prepare for that?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I see. Now, how do I prepare for the meeting with the Mayor?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I am really enjoying this, but, um... Hello! Meeting with the Mayor?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Awww... bourbon go bye-bye.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, the governor wrote me a letter to that effect.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, I can't believe I'm eating steak with the Mayor. The next time I vote for you it's gonna be on purpose.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've outgrown you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, Mr. Mayor! More peanut nore?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, these seats are amazing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bo-ring.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"God, what a great game! And you too can be on the winning team, Mr. Mayor. The Springfield Nuclear Team.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't believe that was work!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, well...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I really should look at this picture a little longer.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, let's go.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can you be my dad?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's a rat race, but it looks like I won.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh sorry, sweetie. Bart can read it to you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And kiss.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Please, Lisa. I had eighteen martinis today.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Close enough.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My work is so meaningless.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You can't touch electricity, Marge. You can't feel it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It already is killing me, Marge. You're the only one I can talk to. My wife just doesn't get it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"My job is my wife. Loneliness, my mistress. Despair, my sex buddy. Angst is a chick I met online, but then it turned out it was really a guy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You don't understand me. Only she understands me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Another round, kid?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... I got here after you did.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Tell her I'm at a meeting, not drinking...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Of course, of course. Family is everything to us company men. Now, where shall we go on your vacation?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's great, let me run the numbers because I really want the Simpson account. And give these cigars to your children.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're not a client. You're the client.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll handle it. I always do.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Burns, I can't go rafting with you because-- wait a minute, could this all work?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh no you don't.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It all fits. Mr. Burns, rafting it is.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now relax, Dottie. Leave everything to me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Marge, this is the most romantic trip you ever nagged me into.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not sure what you're going for, but",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh... Marge, why don't I catch us some salmon?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well I, uh, found that contact lens I was missing. Lemme just screw her back in.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, everybody good?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh-oh. If you've got that, then...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Enjoy the outdoors you stupid kid!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This family time is so precious. Gotta go.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Let's see, my family gives me love and sex. My work gives me money and sleep...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My co-workers are like a family. But in some ways my family is like a family too...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whose side are you on?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks. Now if you'll excuse me, I don't really like bourbon or business talk, just good old Simpson family fun.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey kids, I'm it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm okay! And I found some gold!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yep, your worries are over. I'm back to being a boring old Safety Inspector at a nuclear power plant.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's closing?! But where will people find clips of old TV shows if they're not housed in a giant building? Where? Where?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart! Thank God I had this in my pocket.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My pants are splitting wide open!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And people will see my tattoo of Donald Duck smoking a doob! That was for Marge's eyes only! Oh my God!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fatso Flanagan!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Only the funniest black-and-white man ever!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Everything's a rip-off of ""The Honeymooners."" Margie, you're the greatest.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They were so childless and miserable.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How would you know?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, let me ask you something: is there a place for an old-fashioned lardass like me on today's television?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Would I!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now I hate him too.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What about mimes?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good one, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Everything's perfect about the past except how it led to the present!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, I can't believe we're in the audience of a pay-cable show!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll never eat turkey again. Marge, we got any ham?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Christmas card photos?!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Are we done yet? ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is about to start. I wonder what my life would've been like if I'd never seen that movie...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shut up!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Marge, how would you like some ""future sex""?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I meant a week from tomorrow. That's when the new penis gets here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooo, a b-mail!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I got a b-mail too! ""You have won a valuable prize! Open now""...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Too late!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, after I stopped drinking, this was a way to stay close to my bottles.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'd smash 'em all for one lousy beer.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I just like to dress up to eat my carrots and smoke.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who wants to go to the park and ride the merry-go-nowhere?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, sweetie. Marge said there was some family tension. And at Christmas of all times.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Bloody Harry"" -- he brought back beheading in a big way! Now, I'm gonna show these boys downtown Springfield.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, don't worry, I have my invisibility cloak. Now where did I put it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is where my father is.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"He froze himself because he was sick, and there was no cure.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, they found it. But don't tell him. This is way cheaper than a nursing home.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dad, these are your great-grandsons.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,See you next Christmas!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"To prove a point. Everyone thinks their Dad's a jerk and everyone's right. But when you get older, you realize how much you love 'em.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Your Dad may be a little immature, but I know he loves you, so you ought to give him a chance.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is it snowing down here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If those kids can forgive that train wreck of a father, then maybe I can forgive...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I love you, Dad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Finally. The only thing I wait in lines this long for are for slightly-better cell phones.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I just don't understand the world of grownups.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Absolutely. Let me just redistribute our thingies amongst our various bags.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,High school yearbooks...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't argue in front of the airport line. Strangers are judging our marriage!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, do we really need all these feminine products?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, but I never use that kind of toothpaste!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Try to catch one on your tongue.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Can you focus on my shoulders -- that's where I carry my stress.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, if I fart, that's 'cause I'm so relaxed.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes there is! Woo hoo.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh? What the--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I have to go to the bathroom!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't tread on pee! We probably have rights!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Airlines don't treat people like people anymore!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You make us beg for a filthy pillow that a barnyard rat wouldn't curl up and die in! And watch pre-taped messages that make crashing look like fun!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Never putting me next to a pretty girl...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, all I want is what everybody wants: preferential treatment!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You can check my carry-on, but you can't check my spirit! And why is there moisture between the windows?! And don't wake me up to land! Just land!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I regret nothing... except this part!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm still gonna make my flight, right? 'Cause if not, you have to put me up in a first class hotel... that's how it works. I...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You can't check my spirit!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And why is there moisture in between the windows?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And don't wake me up to land!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What gave me away?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Because of that dumb viral video with a hundred and fifty million hits, I can't go out in public.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"They love me! The quiet Homer Simpson that kept it all bottled up inside is dead. This is the birth of Homer Simpson, blowhard! I'm on the roll of my life! Gimme a scratcher!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Give me another one!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Almost a winner!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! I'm famous again!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, if I could explain myself...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes. Yes! Got it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not so fast!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, I may not be some mani-pedied TV blowhard...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But I do speak for the common man who does his lousy job, goes to church twice a year and watches women's tennis 'cause he likes to hear 'em grunt. I bet Chuck the cameraman and Steve the sound guy know where I'm coming from.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about! Those real people out there who buy their coffee from the mini-mart, and grab enough sugar packs for a week! Honest, hardworking, sugar-stealing Americans!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, son. Now I regret bad-mouthing you to that girl you liked.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Finally. But I want to do it my way: classy and sophisticated.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Welcome to ""Gut Check With Homer Simpson""! Where the truth is served, with a side of in your face!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I am Homer Simpson.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,America's latest teller of truth with a book deal on the side.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Audio book read by Lenny. I'm not just another loudmouth. I'm a loudmouth who says things you're afraid to say BUT NOT RACIST THINGS!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let's go to the map.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Zoomy, zoomy, zoomy Dateline, Nebraska.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A high school principal has decided that football is too dangerous, so he's replacing it with soccer!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Goodnight and good gravy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Are you ready for Irish announcers with lyrical accents, ""Oh, that's a lovely touch! Oh, such beautiful form!"" If we lose football, we lose the blitz, cheerleaders, Rudys, Ochocincos... something for fat kids to play! Ochocincos...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah, that's right. It's already happening, people. Hoard your toilet paper! Shoot the mailman! Shoot the mailman!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is going so great. I'm already a Halloween mask.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's still a great honor!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Great question. I know you children have never seen your father cry before... Marge, do we have any more gravy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why? Oh why?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Marge, don't worry. People know I'm doing a character, like Stephen Colbert, or Newt Gingrich.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Welcome back to ""Gut Check."" I have something very, very pro-American to share with you. Come with me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Death to America! I mean, over here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You all know I'm a big fan of American meat. Although, sometimes you've gotta cut off some of the gristle.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Take that, centers of art and commerce. And this country has something extra that makes our meat the juiciest, most melt-in-your-mouth, stay-in-your-heart meat in the world. That's right, I'm talkin' about the gravy of freedom!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"When March Madness spills into April -- that's the gravy! When someone messes with you, and you invade the country that did it plus another one -- that's the gravy! When you stick your flag in the moon and say ""now we're done tryin'"" -- that's the gravy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So get on the boat... the gravy boat.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Great show, people. Great show. Um... Not a big deal, but next time can we use real gravy instead of brown paint? Not a big deal.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just an innocuous little symbol like a smiley face or a like an I.O.U.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, sweetie. I think I know how to whip up an audience just short of a frenzy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm going to meet with the Republican establishment and pick their nominee! If there's sandwiches there, you want me to bring some back?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then what percent above one hundred are you behind me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Only one hundred percent?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now Lisa, I'm an entertainer. And you can't entertain and inform at the same time. And if you're Access Hollywood, you do neither!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know. Can't we get Chris Christie to run?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh, maybe I'll vote democrat. The great thing is when they get in they act like Republicans.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ted Nugent! I made love on my honeymoon to your sweet music. You're my man.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh? Who's there?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mozart!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can we get some pizza on the way?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,They sell some at the gas station.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, how come your picture's not on money?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do you give 'em out for fans? 'Cause I'm a fan.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's this? Some kind of bi-centennial lemon party?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nerds! You want I should mess 'em up?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But gravy is the freedom where--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Congress shall have the Power To lay and collect Taxes... no new States shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any other Staaaate...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no, John Hancock! I don't need insurance! Sam Adams, I'm sorry I made fun of your winter ale!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It was all a dream! Oh Marge, Oscar Madison came to me and told me that politics are serious and important!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, you were right! I'm not going to endorse anybody for anything!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, the will of the people should not be subverted by demagogues who... hey, what's this?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Springfield Colonial Village?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You faked it?! Lisa, how could you?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's what a play within a play is for!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, if there's one thing I don't like being taught, it's a lesson. I'm so mad. Not only will I endorse Ted Nugent...but I will call for an end to the direct election of senators.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really? That made sense? Then I'm definitely doing it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Folks, because I love democracy so much, I command you to vote for this man whom I alone have selected as your next President:",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now to baptize his candidacy with my tears. The words ""strutting stadium rocker"" are overused these days, but when I first met Ted Nugent...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What? My emotions were so powerful...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's not working... But why?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my God, she's right. My lips will say anything, but my eyes know the truth. My ears are keeping their mouth shut.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My fellow Americans... I am full of crap.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I GOT A GOOD SONG FEVER / A TED NUGENT FEVER / SOMETHING SOMETHING FEVER...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I GOT THIS SONG FEVER,,,,,
Homer Simpson,WE GOT AMERICA FEVER / WE GOT AMERICA FEVER!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"U.S. OF A! Great song, Ted. When's our next gig? Are we goin' to New York, or--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Leave her alone! That's my only talking daughter!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Down in front!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dammit! Why do kids have heads?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I'm invested in the characters.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I make my own turnoffs.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And that, kids, is how you stick it to the Towne Centre Real Estate Investment Trust. No, no, no. Woo hoo!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no, no, no, let's see how long we can keep 'em waiting. Everyone act like we're buckling up to go home.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, if you were married to Da Vinci, you wouldn't tell him not to Da Vinch.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Leaving? Why on earth would you think that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And ours!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This place is so great. When the trolley hits you, it doesn't even hurt.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You try it, Maggie!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do-over!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Unspool it into my mouth till that card is at zero.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Draw the curtain.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sir, as a complexion scientist, I must advise you against using any more. This is the most powerful hydrator we sell.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Less blathering, more slathering.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't trust this place. Where are the cashiers?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll take it! Provided you charge me for services that Google offers for free.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sweet!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This computer is so great! I'm watching the latest Sofia Coppola movie at ""twenty times"" speed to make it seem like a normal movie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, sweetie. Hey, why don't you make friends with my new computer?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let me just download the complete works of Shakespeare.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now who's the greatest writer of all time?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I've created something that created something incredibly popular!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You never showed it to me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I still wanna see it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then why did you say it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you just saying that 'cause you don't want me to see the hippo?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man, this website makes talking drunk to my wife so much safer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I am sitting here... zero sheets to the wind...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...counting the moments to closing time when I can stumble home to you. Another round, Moe. Uh-oh. Did I type that? Delete! Delete! Hm, typing ""delete"" does not delete.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the! That idiot cut me off!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm gonna run his plates, find out who he is, then change his SpringFace profile picture to a shot of a monkey. Get that, Marge? A monkey!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Right. Status update: Homer... is... watching... the...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marco!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, Lisa!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fish out of water!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...and that's why I really don't believe there's a God. Thank you, and God bless America.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well I'm pretty sure it was in there somewhere.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Witty.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Needs flavor.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's better.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oxygen... I need oxygen.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Marge, this is brilliant.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We show girls love on Valentine's Day, and they let us blow stuff up on the Fourth of July. I just pray they never fall on the same day.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thanks for reading it to me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Which one do you want?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You have the most wonderful Mom in the world, which is why I have no idea where she is or what she's doing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's right, sucker! It's Valentine's Day, and I've got a date with some fastballs!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Almost there, boy. Almost there. Almost there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm getting' closer. It's just within reach.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, your arms are lanky. It's kind of a long trip down there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hm, the French have gotten into the wine game. Good luck catchin' up with the big boys.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, Dad, what kind of stupid idea did you put in Lisa's head?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Did you say ""ultimate Frisbee?""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Women and shoes, am I right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, ladies! I'm-a comin'!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, I heard if a fat guy stops moving, he floats.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Dad. I was afraid the dragon wouldn't cough the moon back up.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then why am I paying eight hundred dollars a year in dragon insurance?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, everyone knows dragons do not attack cars. Jeez, pick up a book.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then you have a serious reading problem.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So do your farting now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry. My last words will be ""I can outrun that lion.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, everybody in!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Two can play at that game.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can do this... I can do this...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, I told you an hour ago. Stop that!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I can drive drunk while I'm actually sober!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's fun, but not as fun.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh honey, why must you always assume that a huge picture of us, at a secret meeting we weren't told about, is a bad thing?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah. We're like family to you. I'm talking to you, headphone-bus driver guy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We won! Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, now, now just a second here! Now, I know we're not perfect. But, uh, I believe it was Sammy Hagar who said--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I always thought ""tarred and feathered"" was just a figure of speech.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Good luck patching potholes and stuffing pillows now!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait! If you banish us, you shall be cursed with a thousand-year drought.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I mean a thousand-year flood!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I mean a thousand years of perfect weather.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Soda, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, let's face it. I'm the one that's brought this fate upon us. And there's only one way out: I've gotta man up. Okay, manning up... manning up. Mannning-- Girling down! Girling down!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Please. Put that down.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not you! Him!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We found a new home! When God shuts a door, he opens a window.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh, I'm sick of watching Fox. Let's get some fresh air. I got the ATV's right out back.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Helmet? That's Springfield talk.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Springfield talk!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Private plane crashes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yep, I never realized how much I hated every single one of my friends and relatives.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well I've got a really big secret for you... I'm not wearing any underwear.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey baby, banned forever doesn't mean you can't go back sometimes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Pipe down, boy. I'm sneaking you back into Springfield.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, ""Smithers""!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Pish tosh, Smithers, and fiddle-dee-dee! Nailed it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Excellent.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know what's great about you, Marge? After all these years you can still shinny up the donut, and then pull me up after you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do you ever wonder if there are donut shops on other planets?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Strike! Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ever since the day we met.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The old homestead. Remember when we moved in and I talked like this?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,There's no sex like fugitive sex.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Someone's downstairs!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right! You caught us. What are you gonna do about it? Throw us out of town again?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We hate opera!,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Now, I gotta warn you, if you find a little black thing on your pillow, it won't be a mint.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Let her slice off the tip of your ear, and she'll go right to sleep.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's not a choice you get to make.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Forget it. We don't need some big city bartender chargin' us an arm and a leg for something we can do ourselves.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I rented that plane.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"True, true.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes! Awake! Let's do this!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know sweetie, there was a time when I would've killed for that information, but I'm pleased to announce I've already bought your mother a present.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And brace yourself: I put some thought into it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's a state-of-the-art food mash-'em-upper.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Love?! Your Mom's gonna feel so good it'll make mere ""love"" seem like chewing tinfoil. Because today I'm getting it autographed.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,Yeah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man, oh man, look at this place! Finally, a supermarket with a clear premise: island something.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow. I don't believe the Simpsons will be shopping at the Kwik-E-Mart anymore.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Apu! What are you doing out of your natural habitat?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Friends are the only people you can betray! And you'd do it in a second for a supermarket that gives free coffee samples!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Would you sign this for my wife Marge? She's a big fan and her birthday is tomorrow.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You would do that? Oh my God, this might be a Marge's birthday where I get sex!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait one sec, Marge. Before you open it, you're gonna get a phone call that will make this your most awesome birthday ever.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The only golf we'll watch is ladies' golf, and we're not watching that. Now in three... two... one...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I repeat. One...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Onnnnnnneee...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,...Onnneee... onnneee...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Onnneee.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This yolk-separating camera-hog was supposed to call you and say happy birthday! From her show!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A pity kiss?! That tears it! I'm gonna call that Paula Paul and give her a piece of my mind!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The phone's dead.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Normal, normal, normal, normal... uncharacteristic?! Hm, a chew-through. What could have...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Aw... I mean arrrgh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You let this monster into our home! Where he chewed through our one and only phone cord!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why you little... I'm gonna get... No, Homer. You can't strangle a boy on his mother's birthday. Juries hate that. So instead, boy, I want you to... get in that rabbit cage!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No backtalk! In the cage! Now!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get in there!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, do you have a minute?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've been thinking. I really shouldn't have put you in there and left you there while we were having pizza without you. So I'm gonna let you out with my apologies.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, get out of that cage!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll poke a broom in there! You know I'm capable of it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid kid.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This isn't comfortable at all! I don't see how a rabbit could possibly--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,DRI-VING-TO-WORK!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute... that guy on the poster looks familiar.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't just stare back at me, come up with a theory! Geez, it's all over the place. Holy Moly.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Heard about this thing, boy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hm, sounds like a lie, but what could he be covering up?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not now, Marge!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, you like this necklace I just bought?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Pretty dope, don't you think?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Bart, check this out.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look at me, I'm Mr. Fatso! It's funny 'cause it's so preposterous.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the--,,,,,

Homer Simpson,Shut up! I'll fix you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, master.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here car. Here, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...,,,,,

Homer Simpson,You just ruined my car.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Five hundred dollars? Woo-hoo! Thanks, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Really, anyone? What about the Hulk riding a rhinoceros? Would you stop him from laughing?",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Chief, I believe I have the answer in the back of my car.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Did you guys see that stupid foul call in the game last night?,,,,,

Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How ya doin' there?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well sir, before I do anything I stop and ask myself, ""What would Jesus and Mr. Burns do?""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Y'know boy, my dad used to take me fishing just like this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,More angry texts from work!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, it's called ""karma.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A common misconception.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Suck it, karma! Yeah! I'm talkin' to you, karma! Karma's a bitch, karma!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nothin' better than a lazy Saturday morning, lying in a warm, moist bed. Because weekends are-- Moist?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I wet the bed! The one embarrassing thing I've never done!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, from time to time I've heard you speak of a ""washing"" ""machine."" Where would I find this marvelous contraption?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not just the laundry... That would be weird, and you might ask questions. I wanna do all the chores!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't yell at me, brain! This happened on your watch! You have two jobs: thinking and bladder control!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I like to watch Lamar Odom play X-Box while his giant wife yells at him. Is that so nuts? Huh? Yeah, shut you up.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, I'm sure yesterday's incident of urination domination was a one-time deal. But just to make sure...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why can't I cork my wang-wine?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But isn't karma just an expression of the dharma?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Deep down, I must be feeling guilty about getting my friends in trouble! And my problem won't stop till I make things right with them. But first, a little more sleep.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm sorry. Cheese on that? Sorry. Hey, Lenny. Sorry.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"One more announcement: make sure you whack ""piÃ±ata me"" and not real me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, I gotta know... do you guys forgive me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Free? Uh...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Free it is!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, guys. Tomorrow morning my sheets will be as dry as the surface of Mars except for the poles.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the?! Wet again?! I did the right thing for nothing! There's only one solution left.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay... Place detection pad here... connect alarm hookup... there!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now that's what I call looking out for number one.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um, uh... probably just the fire alarm -- try to go back to sleep.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You stupid...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, I'm afraid the Uralarm Whiz-no-more 9000 is no joke.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kids, there's something I have to tell you -- your mother and I are wetting the bed.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, when you were pregnant everything was ""we.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?,,,,,

Homer Simpson,What about Cupid? He's smokin' hot.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, it's not the diaper, it's what's inside.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,BUM-BA-BUM-BA / BUM-BA-BUM-BA...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, guys! Whatcha doing in my dream?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What do I do?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My brain's fine! In my dreams I'm an intermediate skier!,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Uh, Marge, this is my friend Keggy...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,

Homer Simpson,Whee! I'm in me! / Oh! / I love the down parts! Here comes!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Quick! Gum up the gears with Moes!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Death, you're a lifesaver!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thank you, Death. And may I ask what's taking so long with Larry King?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mom?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just like my hair.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Exactly like Chandler, always criticizing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Roomy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,There's nothing in this dream world that can't strangle you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You left him because I tipped the boat over and ruined the vacation!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's true! I failed the basic duty of childhood. And then when I took Bart fishing, it all came back -- and the guilt made me wet the bed!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm cured. I'll never wet the bed again.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No can do, baby.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Goodbye.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Woo-hoo! I'm dry! Come on, everybody! Feel daddy's underpants!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So what do I do again?,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"It's just dream hail! Ow! Oh! Ow! Dream hail! Hey, there's a dream truck!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thank you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Thank God it's T.G.I.F!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're outta here, drug-o.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well... I didn't really feel like going to Moe's today... thought I might hang out here for as long as I can take it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah... but a weekend without drinking is no big deal. I did it when I was in that alcohol-induced coma.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, what's on the agenda?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why did I do that? / It sounds so dull and boring. / What was I thinking?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What the-- Section 1 of Article 21 of the State Constitution is amended to read: Section 1.

Liquor... mustn't think of liquor...",,,,,

Homer Simpson,A surprisingly not-horrible fruit drink called a mimosa.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then there's champagne in me! What am I gonna do? It's less than twenty-four hours till my drug test. Maybe I can sweat it out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh man, I'd better have some coffee and iced tea.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What about this lemonade?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Then I'd better soak up the alcohol with some food! Oooh, cake!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Crepes!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cherries!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Jubilee!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Lord, I have once again besotted my liver with thy fermented gifts. If you can weasel me out of this physical, I will blow your mind by doing something incredibly holy, at some point. Amen. Now to mumble in a religious fashion. Dear God, oh, Lord oh God, oh, Lord...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Comicon nerds!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A must!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Burns, before I leave, I've got a few things to get off my chest: one: I liked the new microwave in the break room -- just push ""popcorn"". You don't have to know how long. Two: replacing us with robots is heartless and despicable. Three: how about a farewell party with a caricature artist? You know, it's something both kids and adults can enjoy. So to sum up: nicely-done, we hate you, and food for thought.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Does the chair go back like this?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nice parking, idiot.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,So you guys have any luck finding a new job?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maybe I should be heading home.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"WHEN THE MOON HITS YOUR EYE / LIKE A BIG PIZZA PIE / THAT'S AMORE / WHEN THE WORLD SEEMS... When you do chair gondola all by yourself, it almost seems stupid.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, here it is: Hydraulic systems flush... EEPROM bios autoboot... conversation mode? They can talk?!",,,,,

Homer Simpson,That's exactly what I'm having! You guys totally get me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Could you give my wife a few lessons?,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Now, let me raise this beer to toast...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, save your breath.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I have some adjustments to make.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,When I'm done with my robo-botomies.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Flanders, I don't judge a robot by the color of their eyes. I look at their hands, which have turned into buzz saws.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sonofa-- Why did you do that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just say ""kill me,"" jerks!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm doomed! Can they climb stairs?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm doomed!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Robots... trying to kill me... and now they'll kill you... 'cause I led them here...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Aren't we getting num-nums?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry. Before we die, can you tell me how old you really are?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Guys, thank you. The words ""prime directive"" get thrown around a lot these days, but I'm glad yours was saving me. The saddest part is none of this had to happen, if Mr. Burns had simply trusted the human worker. Or if someone, anyone had told me that robots were incapable of human feelings.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And his arm can be my back-scratcher.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm giving you your wish: to be a real boy.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,Bart! There's a really mean squirrel in the back yard. I need you to dare me to fight him!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart's been raptured! And his crap's been craptured!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nice doin' business with you, boy.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,I never even got to realize this jacket was too small.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge... your names...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, for you kids maybe. For dads, a family vacation is a twenty-four-hour-a-day babysitting job! ""Are you wearing enough sun block?"" ""Is that splashing or drowning?""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why does every sand castle require my participation?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then a kid disappears and it's total panic until you find him at the swim-up bar...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,...eating a thirty-dollar cheeseburger! Which he drops in the water!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And here's the worst part: I never get any time alone with my wife because we're all sleeping in the same room!,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"I get it. You need your Marge time. Well, I'm off to work.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"My feet hurt, and my neck is cold.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,What do I do? What do I do?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're right, Marge. I lied.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I got a head injury at work, and they gave me eight weeks paid vacation.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I spent all that time learning how to be a better husband. The kind of husband you deserve.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The three of us are going to the most romantic restaurant in town.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I have bug-bombed the car for m'lady.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It was all a training exercise to make me smooth for you. Of course she fell for me and of course I wanted no part of her. Now, the only one who can help us is Stradivarius Cain.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll explain later. Strad! Come back! I know you're in there!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No... not you... next... big fan but no... Cleatus the Football Robot, you're my only hope!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No one likes you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Strad, where are you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"When I was in special ops, they held me in an Afghan prison where all I could see was a patch of blue sky. But that blue was nothing compared with the blue of your eyes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We used to be like them.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Actually, I was supposed to be back last week. We'll just wait for the call from human resources.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I better get going -- this is startin' to feel a little churchy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I already have my part: man who buys ticket but doesn't show up.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Maybe it was once, but now there's lots of better stories...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Game Six of the 2011 World Series...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,...And Lenny's story about Cancun.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just like me on Twitter!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm your Jesus! Me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's that a reference to?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, nice and roomy. Our Lord sure knew how to keep 'em cool.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, sweetie?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whee! Whee!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yes, Lisa, very seriously. Whee.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Lord, why have you placed this fearsome burden on my shoulders?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Does Jesus have a big part in this thing?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?! Why do I succeed at everything I audition for?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thou sayest it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,They cannot judge me. Only my Father can judge me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll take you with me, old man!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mmm, historically inaccurate.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ooo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me but weep for yourselves.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Tonight, you shall be at my right hand in Heaven.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Outta my way, stupid Flanders!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooo, licorice!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Welcome to marriage! Another good man bites the dust.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm talkin' about this guy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I sure envy him.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I mean I envy Flanders, once again enjoying the joys of marriage. Let's put it to a vote, America.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart! Don't call me that!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why you little... they're both bad, and I suspect you know it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,People here do not respect boundaries.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Great, we'll take care of everything. We'll just need to borrow your punch bowl, seventeen chairs, your portable dance floor, your banner printer, banner ink, and a ream of blank banners.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You really put on a great reception, Marge. It's like the happy flashback in a gritty cop thriller.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"He took the time to press the shift key, Marge! I think he knows what he's talking about.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Marge, let the kid have his embarrassing secrets and lies.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not according to the internet!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm sure some idiot somewhere agrees with me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Because his avatar is Darth Maul! The second-coolest Darth!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And what he says is true because it's in all caps. Are you gonna argue with caps?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but we make sure never to go to bed hungry.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't tell me what our thing is.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I've always said ""hungry""!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I thought I heard clicks and pops!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Welcome, money-changers! You can trust Sleazy Sam for the best rates, or my name isn't Jesus H.--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you gonna do that every time I open one of these?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,WILL YOU STOP THIS STUPID CRAP? / I WANNA TAKE A NAP!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's wrong with her?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where are they going with this?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You wanna honk your jazz tube?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I appreciate that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, why don't we go see Lady Gaga? That'll turn your frown upside down.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What are you talking about? Y-you're right!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I will, but you know me and my crazy number thing where I always have to get to seventeen. Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Whoops, I lost count. Better start again. Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Lisa, come on.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow. Wow. This is like the night Hillary won the New Hampshire Primary.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can I just trim the hem?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay Lisa, comin' up to make things better!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, I'm almost there... upward, ever upward... stay hydrated... I'm on the wrong tree... Okay, try again... here we go, okay...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, can you come down?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sweetie, I've been thinking. Now, this all started because you used a fake name to defend yourself. The problem's not that you were cheating...it's that you got caught.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I cheat on my diet but nobody knows 'cause the damage is on the inside and the first warning sign is sudden death. So, honey, what do you say?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Parenting. It's the one job you always know you're doing right.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I LOVE MY HOMER FACE YEAH THAT'S WHAT I SAID / RIGHT WHERE IT SHOULD BE ON THE FRONT OF MY HEAD / STUBBLE, MUZZLE, OVERBITE, TWO EYES THAT REALLY BUG / THESE ARE THE COMPONENTS OF MY HOMER-RIFFIC MUG / D'OH, OOOH, D'OH, OOOH, / I SHAVE IT CLOSE, TRIM HAIRS FROM MY NOSE / D'OH, OOOH, D'OH, OOOH, I CLEAN MY EARS, 'CAUSE THAT'S HOW I HEARS / I LIKE MY / I LIKE MY / I REALLY LIKE MY HOMER FACE",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait for the gap... wait for the gap...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,There's the gap!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gap's too small!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's goin' on?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, if anyone needs me I'll be taking a popcorn bath. It's a thing I read about in a Men's Health magazine in a dream.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Pfft, look in the mirror, unplanned miracle.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well... I also keep things interesting.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You see? Hey, what are you looking at?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw boy, I feel for ya. Nobody likes to be rejected, and it never gets easier, until you can drink. Because then you can express your unfiltered feelings by drunk dialing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Observe. Hey, it's me again. He's there, isn't he? Well, I hope this doesn't sound weird, but I'm inside your closet.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, it's me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I was thinking about you. It's your birthday in like three, four months? Would it be weird if I threw you a party?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...And five hundred dollars for Yankee tickets, which turn out to be bogus...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But they're playing the Purple Sox!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lousy outdated relics! Boy, do you remember what happened the last time we went to New York?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're dead, J.J. Get yourself buried!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm about to go owl shooting... and you just said ""who!""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're sellin' milk, J.J., and I've got a sour stomach.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It didn't feel like success.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, you can dial down the crazy. Your mother and I talked about it and we found a way to get to New York. It's all set, boy. To save money, we're swapping houses.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I didn't say I swapped our house.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look at this place. Things have certainly changed since our ancestor Fievel came here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, and now look at us. Only in America.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, geez. Not this guy, with his stupid little pushcart.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You do that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do you know you're missing your clothes?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, I'll spring for a cab.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Much better.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh-oh-oh oh, thank God you woke up!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You've learned a very valuable life lesson, boy, which is that love doesn't exist except briefly between a man and a woman before marriage. After that, it's just hanging out with someone who kind of hates you, but you can't get it together to leave. I'll get us some ice cream.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little... where's that ice cream?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Damn you and your fluted neck!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I thought there was no crime in New York any more. Giulianiii!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Go where?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, you squeal like a piggy for the hillbilly man!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, look at that -- my little guy's finally realizing how complicated grown-up feelings can be.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Heh, no kidding, I saw your reviews.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I hope you enjoyed the show tonight. And if you're worried about when the air conditioner fell on my head, rest assured it was a stunt man and his family is being well taken care of.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do we screw them on the credit?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,At least the pennant works both ways.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lisa! Do you have a stray dog down there?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Two stray dogs?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That was gonna be my next guess!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maybe.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A black hole? I'm sorry, can we call it that?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, can it open a pretzel bag for me? Help a brother out, B.H.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, you can't look at that infinitely dense little guy and not want to feed it something!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why should--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I am nature's perfect choking machine!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nope. / Not me. / Do we even still have that thing?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, it's possible that someone may have started a business called ""Magic Craphole Waste Removal,"" but it wasn't me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Treasures? Gifts? You got it all wrong. That stuff is just our old--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Day one.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We've bought this camera because strange things have been going on at our house in the dead of night.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And if anyone finds this footage after we're all missing or dead, remember me as a hero.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A hero.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hero away!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Night One. Wanna snuggle?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I turned it off.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I swear, I am not filming.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Note to self: edit out my lies.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait! Don't kill the monster without me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm right behind you, honey! We have stairs?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, sweetie, sometimes a mysterious, invisible being from hell waits for a family to go to sleep then kills them. Now go to bed.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh-eh, school night.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now you're sure I bought enough cameras and extended warranties to catch that ghost?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, I can't wait for tonight's massacre.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, like what you see, huh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I like it when you don't say words.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen, pal, you seem like an honest guy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is there any other deal that you can accept?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You, me and Marge?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I guess it's one of those things a dad has to do...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, before we start, what's the safe word?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, I like that. Now, I'd like to try something new if you don't mind...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cinnamon!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Would you go to the prom with me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll get right on it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm on it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"For the third time this year, yes!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I gotta hand it to you, Marge. You got the exact amount of car for our family. Room for two adults, three kids, and zero Grampas.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let Automobile Von Bismarck give it a try.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, you're not totally unqualified.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A reason? What could it be?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, an auto mechanic who tells the truth.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Umm... no thanks.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge... do you think maybe there's another reason you don't like this car? Um... um... a ""feelings"" reason?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, maybe you and the car got off on the wrong foot. When do you think things first went wrong?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no, Marge. I want you to explore your feelings.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"An ""on purpose"" baby?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What about... you know... ""Stinky""?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whatever you want, sweetie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just appreciating how lucky I am to be with you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And let me tell you, a towel rack will not support your weight.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,X's for eyes...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Honey, I am so sorry. I guess we'll just have to learn to love the three children we have.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, uh... hm... why don't we take the longer but nicer historic route? Then today will be nothing but beautiful memories.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry guys. Private family moment.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh, nothing we can do.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's true... that's how I got the money to buy you your necklace.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I, uh, hope it's twins!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Watch it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, but just for a minute. We want to hit the candle store, Fudgerama, the Zipper Hall of Fame, Snow Globe World, and The Taj Meatball.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I got to try every flavor of candy cane: white and red.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What's that, baby?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll take it from here, wing-man.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, no kids to ruin it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I was just being a good husband by pretending to agree with you while secretly undermining your agenda.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, well, looking back, I guess it started sometime before Bart was born.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Room for one, please.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Honey, I'm sorry. It's just that we have a hard enough time handling three kids.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Emotionally, financially, the boy... I just didn't know how to tell you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, good, we're talking...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Your phone just dialed me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, the pocket wants what it wants.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"They just leave the maple syrup on the table, huh? How about that? That's trust, huh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh. I don't think I rewound the video the last time I was here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um, I'd like to get back a donation made fifteen years ago by a Simpson, Homer. Or it may be under the name Thad Supersperm.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll tell you what I want, Marge. I want to make another Simpson. The table with four legs is sturdier than the table with three. Cubes are made of cheese, but pyramids are schemes. And anything that's half you is guaranteed fifty percent perfect.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you sure there isn't more? I mean there's always a little ketchup left in the bottle.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'd like to buy back my sample.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I expected a little argument.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Geez. I mean, I'm no Luis Guzman, but I'm all right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Um... remember that Corvette I had?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is the worst pain imaginable!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Exactly. Well, we're all set. Let's make a Thad Supersperm Junior. With a name like that, he could be president.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I was really looking forward to...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're right, Marge. I don't wanna bring more kids into a world full of my kids.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Two adults, please.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Another thing that would be harder with four kids.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pushy sign! Don't tell me what to try!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't recall that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"One onion rings, please.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This one's cold.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"My burns have affected our... intimacy... because all night, I talk about how much money I'm going to make from the lawsuit.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh God! It hurts worse than the burns!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, thought bubble Marge said we should put it in a college fund for Lisa.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I put it in the bank. That place is great! On their wall, they had a photo with an old couple walking on the beach with their pants rolled up.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait, the frog in the trench coat is Kermit too?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That settles it. No banks for me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the--? I'm not gonna gamble with my daughter's future.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A poker site is now safer than an American bank. Has our nation, built on people suing because their onion rings were too hot, come to this?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Open file, click and...invested! Hey Lisa, check out your college fund!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's a classy operation. See, the little dealer's wearing a bowtie. Cute.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,On a poker site!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,On a poker site!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry. Check out my new t-shirt.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I've had it for a long time. I was just about to throw it out, and then this happened.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's one way to avoid drunk driving.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm not Superman.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ha, of course I do! Happy anni... birth... entine... shark week?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What the?! Stupid calendar. First you put the Fourth of July on Sunday, and now this! Ooh, we're gonna discuss this later!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, remember the plan. Apologize to Grampa. Then when he wants us to take him out to lunch, point to the leftovers, tell him we already did, but he forgot.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you take that back!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You take that back!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We're here to see Abe Simpson.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Missing?! What kind of a prison are you people running here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it's hopeless! This room is like a museum of meaningless old crap. By which I mean every museum.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So precious...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look at that, a man's whole life being kicked around on the floor.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Flimsy lead, take me away!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Excuse me, have you seen this man?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm just trying to get information -- like a nosey reporter, or an undercover cop...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Or a spy from a rival gang! Hey, what are you doin'?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Did you say my dad worked here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My dad was an aspiring songwriter like Charles Manson? I never knew that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, what was that singer's name again?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Rita La-what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,One more time.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thank you Mr. Papadapaconstanti-kasgianopolopodopotopolis.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's where we live!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! I get two Christmases!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't believe my Dad never told me he had another wife. The man I looked up to my whole life.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, it's a good thing I didn't because I'd be pretty devastated right now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But we need to know everything, no matter how shameful. And fast!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well just what attracted you to my father?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I was alive when my Dad knew you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My Dad had furniture?! I don't know him at all!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I'm startin' to remember why I don't remember so much.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my God. I never knew the sacrifices my father made. Move over, Fonzie. I've got a new hero.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Holy moly.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's Dad's cologne? I always thought it was his old-man stink.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man, you're making me hot for my Dad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen, do you know this man?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dad!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dad, promise me you'll never wander off and make us explore your fascinating past again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And I don't think you're boring. It's just that in today's multi-channel environment, you have too many great choices. Look at Sunday night. There's like eight amazing shows. None of them on Fox.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Aww.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm payin' for 'em.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's how wolves die in the wild.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The day my Frisbee landed in your yard was the luckiest day of my life...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He's a good boy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What I wouldn't give for an anvil to fall on me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A perfect storm?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"When I prayed for this concert to be over, I didn't mean like this!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I am turning my back, because I can't stand to look you in the face.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart! This is America. Anyone can eat what they want as long as they eat too much.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on buddy, why would you want to be a murderer?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hi... Dan.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Doodie.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my God! You want me to help you escape?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You wha?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,In my business I try not be seen. I'm scary good at it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Please stop. I just wanted my Frisbee back from your yard.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is how I get out of doing the dishes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, I don't, I don't know why I said it... I was scared... I needed a response... it was a perfect storm!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My Dad used to tie me up when the ice cream truck went by. And now there's no amount of ice cream that'll make me feel full. So this should work!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Could you please not sound like you like it so much?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now stay down here and I'll be back every hour with food, and every six hours with food for you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Classic.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Someone must be watching on another TV.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Will you stop saying things that'll make me have to do something?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That was four screams! Stupid A.F.I. Boy, never go into their Director's Training Program!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now how would you qualify for that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Have fun getting coffee for Roy Disney the Third.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dinner time! I know you're hungry! I can hear you rubbing your legs together! Oh my God!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I never thought Homer Simpson would be a part of the Day of the Locust.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you gonna shoot me in the back of the head?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll fix that later!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,On vacation he digs wells in Darfur!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stop!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dan!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You really should tweet less.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh? What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just listen. If you kill those guys, you'll be as bad as they are.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, just give me the gun before you hurt somebody. Give it to me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I knew you were weak.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You are weak, but no.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I don't want to.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't want to see it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're making me mad and I want, I want to shoot you now! / I don't have to see it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Give it to me! / I can imagine it. / Give me the gun! /,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on weakling, get it from me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, well, yeah, well see who's got it now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, you ain't so--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, in a crisis like this, I need time for quiet contemplation.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm in an abusive relationship with life. It keeps beating the hell out of me, and I'm too cowardly to leave it. Maybe I could drink myself to death.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Life is too fragile. One minute you're lying in your hammock drinkin' beer, the next thing you know you're sittin' here drinkin' beer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, come on Chief, I've had a rotten day. Can't you help me out?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can this day get any worse?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dogs can't get mumps.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, that's Tooth Fairy money down the drain, sweetie. I never win anything. It's always some stupid jerk you've never heard of.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Here it comes...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Get him! I mean, woo hoo!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I just want to say, I was having the worst day of my life.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, what else... Free Tibet! You heard me! Free him now! Thank you. Oh, my luck has changed!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I left a half-eaten apple outside your store... the greatest tribute of all.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't wanna.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I submit! I submit!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You can look at it this way...or this way...whether you want to or not... and it's got awesome games like ""Tapped Out.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Virtual Stapler!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sounds just like a stapler, and it never runs out... unless you tell it to. Here's one that gives ya a cool '70s moustache.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm Sonny Bono. Watch out for that tree!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, which do you prefer, m'lady? Tom Selleck, Rollie Fingers or Pringles Man?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I'm not alone. I'm doing some Face Time with Lenny.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The old stupid moustache'll win him over.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm really stupid.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm standing by that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, boss.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Will you kids pipe down! I'm trying to get ""Churro-Chaser"" to tell me where the freshest churros are. What country is Mexico in?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Aww. That'll be my screensaver.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A paper-based read-a-majig? What are we, cavemen?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sweetie, in the future all you'll need is this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What would you have me do? One basket for each egg?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, Maggie let's find a good game for us. Hm, ""Krusty's Kosher Karnival""...""Words With Enemies""...""Don't Burn the Toast!"", ""Lenny Dykstra's Prison Break,"" ooh, ""Pizza Clock""!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dough, sauce, cheese, topping. Dough, sauce, cheese, topping. Dough, sauce, cheese, topping! Having fun, Maggie?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How long have I been playing?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dough, sauce, cheese, topping.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dough, sauce, cheese, topping. Dough, sauce, cheese, topping.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dohhh! Sauce, cheese, topping!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Flushy! Go get help!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It still had eighty-eight percent of its charge!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Which of you is the YouTube of the kid high on dentist's gas? Is it you? Is it you? Is it you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Lord, when things looked darkest, you gave me light. Then you switched it off knowing full well I had declined thy infernal Mapple Care. Please grant me the wisdom to understand your capricious, nasty mind. And please, please make the next swing of the yo-yo an up, amen.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Everybody hear that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Keep your pants on, Flanders.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Has the MyPad risen?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This is your miracle? A tree? Ooh, look at me. I turn sunlight into complex sugars. Big whoop.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Huh. ""Hope."" Is this one of those coincidences like Jesus on a tortilla or George Washington on a dollar bill?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, this is how God would send me a message. In my back yard, hammock adjacent, in one short word in large print. What do you think he's trying to tell me, Flanders?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine. I'll just go eat the body of God. That's not crazy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe, I could believe this was a random occurrence, or I could believe some higher power reached down and squeezed the sap outta that tree. I'm choosin' hope! Moe, a bottle of your finest beer!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,To hope!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, excuse me, Reverend, but I'm here to talk about something a little more important: hope.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hope is here, people, and it's real. It's not just inside the house of God, it's outside the house of me! So come and see the sticky brown truth!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hope is all around me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,As promised: the miracle!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know what to believe anymore. Maybe it's time to call Satan. Is that a two-one-two?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, up to now I thought your hair was blue cotton candy, but now I know it's a solid loaf of brain.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who do you think painted the word on the tree?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Guess it must've been the person who knew I needed hope most of all.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, stop it! You might fall!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Grampa?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This boy's grandfather is a shriveled-up corn cob, begging for death! I am his father... I can't believe I allowed you to hit on me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Beat it, ducks! I'm not old enough to have food for you! I'm sexy! Young and sexy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Old man... I'm not an old man... This drawing doesn't think I'm old.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't you, drawing?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Those aren't our regular donuts! They're huge... with crazy toppings! Gummy worms! Churro chunks! Russian nesting donut!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gotta eat the rest!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,They're gone!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Where did these ""Devil Donuts"" come from?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Get lost, pervs!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, where did you get these donuts?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm calling to report... a missing donut cart.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no, nothing, nope.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I see... devil horns!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"... pitchfork, pointed tail... hooves are... cloven! We have logo, people. We have logo!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No more donuts?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Beer keg do-nut?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I would be honored to shake the hand that glazed this.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Tell me everything about you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're from Portland? I've heard of people being from there.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute, you have kids?! You can't have kids! Look at you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You have a fun job, a skull ring and it's not Halloween... and your belt is a seatbelt...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No one would ever think you're a lame old man.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Our houses are the cheapest! The one next to me's been on sale forever! I see them lowering the price every morning when I go out to pee.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Please. Please rush into this! Please rush into this!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"In my house, we found human bones.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Really? I'm... ...cool? Oh, can I man-hug you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know how.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, our first hang-out with the cool new neighbors. I've already ""blown them away"" -- their words, I assume -- so don't screw it up.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Great, Marge, now that's in their heads.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Star Wars"" Chewy's just a man in a costume, so he's not scary.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""T-Rex?"" Even their names are cool! This is, umm... Ice Cream, Bungee Jump, and... Viral Video.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Check out my new look!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Terence shaved my head!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I'm young person ""cool"" bald, not old person ""sad"" bald. I never want to see these again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Check it out, Flanders, us cool dads are sharing a mono-yard. Guess I can't be your best friend anymore.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boo hoo hoo, you can cry all night. It's not gonna win me back.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I have a plan to deal with that. Step one: change everything about ourselves until we are super cool, the end.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Honey, I'm not cool. I was never cool. I didn't go to college. Every CD I have I bought at a carwash. Black-and-white films make me angry. I can't pronounce ""artis-anal."" I only know David Cross from the Chipmunks movie. Not only do I like Van Halen, but I think they keep getting better...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But if me and my kids do the same stuff as Terence and his kids, I could be a cool dad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, baby. Here, have a bracelet made of a seventies educational film strip.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, we need to take kids to grownup stuff. That's Terence's parenting style--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, you won't be laughing when you see how many pickpockets this thing catches.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wearing scarves in non-scarf weather is the essence of cool. The. Essence.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh man, my goatee has barely come in. Why does my hair only grow in twos?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I hope T-Rex likes the present I made him.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Homemade presents are how cool families demonstrate how awesome they are. If I show up with a ""toy"" from the ""store,"" like we would give ""our kids,"" then I've failed! And these skinny jeans will have flattened my junk for nothing!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,T-Rex loves decaying industrial-scapes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I thought it made blimp tires!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are we still on for midnight bike riding?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh ohhhh boy, oh oh oh oh boy, oh boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"O-o-o-ooooh booooyyyyy... We had the family version of a bromance going with our awesome neighbors, and you had to screw it up.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,He called me... a poser?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You? Sticking up for your old man? You've never done that before.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What? No one judges my wife's thunderbags! Well maybe I was wrong about these people. Who ever thought a cool person could be a jerk?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,They can goatee... hell!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, that's right, the friendship between the Simpsons and the whatever-your-last-name-is-es-es is over!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine. Keep 'em. But you have to give back... Lisa?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Could we at least agree to both hate Flanders?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shut up with your names!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Parenting? Let me tell you ""cool parents"" something. Parents are supposed to be lame... so their kids have something to rebel against... by becoming cool just long enough to get married and have kids -- for whom they are lame! It's nature's way!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Even Flanders agrees! This is our neighborhood. We were here first, so you should leave.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh no, it's true!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stupid town... at least I've still got Moe's... although probably not, seeing where this is going...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What happened here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge, it's bad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I brought these people to Springfield... and now they've taken over!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's a hellhole!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What happened to our town? Everybody wears clothes from the past and uses computers from the future!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, you win. We don't have to be friends, but can we live on the fringes of your world? Like those eels that eat whale poop?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Your organic, all-natural lifestyle has doomed us all!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They're necessary! They're necessary!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,They're finally necessary!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I did it! I did it! I man-hugged!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I can't pick up something this heavy without my lifting belt.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh no! I won't be able to help you pack up Grampa!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hold down the fort?! With my bad back?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man, that keyboard playing cat is so cute.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Villageville. Build your own authentic medieval village. I must have something better to do.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And ca-lick!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Finally, a woodcutter that will do what I tell him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Holy moley! He's already made a clearing! Let's go for a glade!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just call me DeForest Kelley. I gotta write that down and send it to Conan.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Move this here. Tap. Mill! Mill! Barn! Silo! Tavern-tavern-tavern-tavern-tavern-tavern! Brothel. Parsonage! Theater In The Round! And... hay pile...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And the Lord saw what he had made, and it was good.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's right, your Lord sticks his hand in his pants. And yes, it is the same hand I tapped you with.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, if I've learned anything, it's that you can't have too much iron ore.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're back!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's real to them!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know -- the back yard?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my God. I forgot to feed my jackass!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're hel-come!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A lot of good backups. How pregnant is the raccoon?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good, Marge. Get their price down.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not a crier.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Goofing on it made me feel wise!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Prep, prep, prep...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I believe the word is idiote.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I know what must have happened:,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm gonna get a snack. But first... should I introduce the black plague? What could be the harm?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whoa, now I've gotta buy a corpse wagon. That's how they getcha.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's amazing how many things they can make taste like cheese.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah, baby, I'm drinking you down to your knees.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,GONNA DRINK AMMONIA / 'CAUSE IT TASTES LIKE CHEESE / WONDER WHAT WILL HAPPEN...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A minstrel has composed a roundelay mocking me?! Torture, torture, torture!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,He knows I love him. And he loves me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's short for ""Rrright you are!""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How are they his treats if I paid for them?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay. I'll be nicer to the dude. I've just never really been a dog person.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bongo?! I told you never to ever talk about Bongo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ever!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He's still my dog!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't know what you just said, but it's wrong! Wrong, wrong, wrong!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It doesn't make sense to me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I happen to remember it just a little differently.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now granted, I was just a kid, but I say...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Everything's a flavor in the kitchens of today!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Grampa always hated Bongo and loved money so he sold Bongo to a wicked farm witch just so he could hang out with a bunch of rich dogs and kidnapped Santa so I'd never get the toy I actually wanted--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And then... and then wha... and then what happened... what... gee, my story doesn't make much sense except the Santa part.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait. Wait. There's one part of the story even Grampa didn't know about: a few months later, I went to rescue Bongo...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But, there was one thing I wasn't prepared for...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bongo was happy. Without me. He had become her dog.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, that's just the way dogs are. The most disloyal unfaithful creatures God ever made.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,He still has my sweatshirt.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my God, Dad... I owe you an apology. You saved Bongo. I never understood that till now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why would you think that, just because I put you in a home where they feed you dog food?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, but I'm a little out of practice.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What flavor?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If it doesn't matter, then I call Snickers.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My dog.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, Mom, you promised!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Mrs. Simpson.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is this a kid you'd pay ransom for?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Feed it to the dog.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't you tell me how to feed you to the dog!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can't I keep an eye on that kid? He's fabulous.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's always my kids.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where'd they go?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Almost... holy moley...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What the--? Ooh, it's hopeless.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who the hell are you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Absolutely not! My adult frame is simply too large. No! Never! Fine! Here I come!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Crawling... so painful...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,...duck walk... infinitely worse...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sh, sh. Shhhhh. Soon you'll know peace.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I made it, kids! I am king of Learning-ton Castle!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Real matuuure!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What cool kid thing's in here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Never!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Butter.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Apes... deep down we're all savage apes. Leave your body, Homer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the hell was that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I've taken eight months off. It's time to get back on the horse.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I guess despite all our so-called civilization, anarchy lurks around every corner, like a racially-diverse street gang on a network cop show.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,America can't collapse! We're as powerful as ancient Rome!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sweet.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my God! This unsourced, undated video has convinced me beyond any doubt!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Preppies? Oh, I hate you guys! Always partying on deck with your Docksiders while us townies are scrubbing the bilge!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's based on nothing!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'd slash my wrists! But how, without my electric knife?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't conceive of any.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't worry. I am very good at keeping secrets.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Impending doom...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Honey, everything's fine. There's nothing to worry about.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just go play your saxophone while you can.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Secrets? I have no secrets! Just enjoy this golden time you will soon cling desperately to the memory of. Smell some bread!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Typical sheeple.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maybe.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but I'll go home, weigh myself, and I'll have gained six pounds. What's that about?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I guess an open garage isn't the best hiding place.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I wish. Son, the best way to explain this is to show you some age-inappropriate movies.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, what have you learned so far from our post-apocalyptic movie marathon?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hollywood has taught you well, my son. Now let's push ""play.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fridge-ra-torr!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do not question the wisdom of Tom Skerritt.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow. Your end of the world is better than my during the world.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw. Uh, listen, I've gotta know. You're not just being nice to me because in a pinch you could make candles from my fat?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's okay. I know what I am.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Um... a lot of that stuff must've got lost in the move.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I want to tell you but I promised to keep it a secret.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's very late in the marriage to tell me that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've hidden all our supplies behind a fake wall.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,See? These are our bug-out bags. In here is everything we need to survive.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The looming kablooey.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Creepy? Marge, the apocalypse is coming. Maybe not tomorrow, maybe never, but it's coming... and soon.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,There's no handle on this side!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The one thing I couldn't prepare for.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, this is it! TEOTWAWKI!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh-huh, where's the kids?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, get in the car. And say goodbye to your best friend forever.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is my daughter. She brings the gift of music to the new world.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Baritone.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Here's something to pass the endless time. Write down which celebrities were rumored to be gay for future generations.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Society will not have to start from square one.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, when I started prepping for the end of the world, everyone laughed at me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, just because I imagined it doesn't make it any less true. And now all those people are on their own.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,If Jesus had a gun he'd be alive today.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why do we have to shoot them at all?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No! I want to help the people who didn't prepare!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't be silly, ""Mary Ellen.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now we're going to leave this place. I'm sorry, Bart -- I know you've made a bug-out camp girlfriend...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,White rice or brown?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So we'll take these supplies back to Springfield where they're needed most.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hm. I cut the wires to something.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, everybody, keep your eyes peeled for an unlit mile post marked twenty-three of thirty-six or something. If we miss it, we're dead.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How can that be? I took every last can of gas!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, everyone relax and pretend we're about to be hit by a soft brick wall.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Out of our way, corn! The starving people of Springfield are desperately in need of our delivery of canned corn, corn flakes, and flash frozen corn nibblets.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now to save these sorry souls from a life of anarchy, starvation, and having sex for procreation.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You got to watch a VHS copy of ""Red Dawn"" thirteen times. Stop complaining.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We can keep the shrimp de-veiner though, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good riddance. When I found out shrimp cocktails had no alcohol, I really lost interest.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Goodbye, my electrical friends. I can't afford to use you, so I'm doing what any good American would do -- throw you away.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Parking meter?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And it still works!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This could come in handy. But let me check that list of things Marge said never to bring home. Dogs, cats, octopuses, octopi, octopuseseses...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Parking meter, you're workin' for me now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lotta people at the dump today.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This is the easiest money I've ever made, lugging around a ninety pound parking meter!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's not that kind!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, now to drag the meter to the next idiot.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh God, my back! Suckers! My discs are grinding! Easy money!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We're cool, right boy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now to sleep the sleep of the just.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm king of the bus station!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eat silver, copper!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stay with me, man. Stay with me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no! You're the first successful business I've ever run!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The pillows are safe at my workstation. As for the quarters... well, I'm ashamed to tell you what I did.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How long have you been in there?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,...and I wish that Mr. Teeny gets a banana ... that the Isotopes emerge from this season with a great blooper reel ... I wish that wishing wells worked so I wasn't just tossing my money away ... and that Marge loves me forever no matter what stupid things I do ...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Way to get us back on topic, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You live like this?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dear Lord, if thy tornado must take me, please let it take me to Oz, but don't let Flanders be the Scarecrow!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We made it, boy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my God. Oh my God. This counts as a walk!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The tornado took old what's-his-name! I'm going after him!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lenny, take us with you to find our dog! It's okay, Marge, they're professionals.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maybe the last words I'll ever write.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Maybe! Look, you guys obviously know about weather, but I understand something much more predictable: women.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What women really want is a guy who's confident enough to go completely downhill after marriage and know she'll still love him.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That is the stupidest...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I would never do that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine. But I swear: I will win you back from Lenny.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Help me, God! What is it I'm paying you for every Sunday?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can always use... a good babysitter.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He was a black guy but his voice sounded like a white guy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, it won't give!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Found another one.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Were you worried about me, boy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Clearly the boy's in shock.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stop being blasÃ©!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now I know you kids are scared by what happened, but it's bedtime. Just go into your dark rooms and shut your eyes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Connecticut?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, you're right. It's hard to imagine anyone else bringing up our kids, but I think the choice is obvious -- my dad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Good point. We'll find somebody else.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I got it, Dad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah? The tornado was more of a father to me than you! Okay, how about my brother? He's rich.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, how very kind of you. I am not giving our kids to these gravelly-voiced super hags! One lump, please.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's some impressive flute-nastics.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Goodbye forever!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, Marge. Maybe we're being a little too choosy about who our kids spend the rest of their lives with. We'll take what we can get.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kids, there's nothing to worry about...but we're looking at replacements for your Mom and me if we should fail to die together as a family.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is not that! And that smart-alecky attitude is exactly why no one wants you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, I'll nudge 'em with the car. We'll get a whole ""meet cute"" thing going.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait! What about that couple? They look pretty cozy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wowww. Your house is perfect. No sharp corners, no unsafe balconies, a cool Grampa...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, Thanks, Dad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow. I assumed The Jackson Five were the only perfect family, but now I see there's another.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, say, listen, Portia. How would you and Mav feel about... um, swinging?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no, no. I meant pushing kids on swings.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, take whatever time you need. I just want to know if you'd like to be their guardians.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man, you sure can talk surfer talk.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maybe this'll help you make up your mind.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You never know when you might wanna mail something.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Worrywart Marge. You don't look a Trojan Horse in the mouth.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I swear to you, Marge, when I have the time, I will Google them both.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, uh, well, he wanted to be here, but I'm gonna decrease the volume of my voice and mumble so you can't really understand what I'm saying...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Great. And now my Dad can notarize.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Name another.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now I can finally complete my bucket list.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Too late! You already signed! Oh wait, there's one more.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Suckers!!! Oh wait, you've gotta initial this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Check mate.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, if they can watch 'em for the rest of their lives they can certainly do it for a weekend.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, no indulgence of mine ever becomes a habit.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It helps me write.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, this has been great couples time. The one thing people with kids desperately need is no kids!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't like the way they just rip the paper off. Santa's Little Helper my ass.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No one steals my kids... except me... from that theme park jail... that I never told you about... except I guess I just did... we're all caught up now... let's go!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Like all childless couples, they troll the beaches waiting for the egg-layers to wander off from their young.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah, man.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, Marge. We'll get 'em. Unless we die on this icy mountain road. Then they've won forever.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Women and their horrible thoughts.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, let me set your mind straight about something -- that spectacular young couple is definitely better for the kids. But those kids are ours, because we made them, by accident. And now, we're gonna take them back because we love them, especially now that we've had a little time apart from them.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I've got a bone to pick with you! Then, an apology to make. Then, we exchange insurance information. Then, more bone picking!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Those better be good breaks.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sure you wanted the fun parts, but do you want to go to their little league games and recitals?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm glad someone has.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We've won. Woo hoo.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Instead of concentrating on dying, we're going to concentrate on living.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I do call this living! Living the way kids in India can only dream of!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I win!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I forget.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ladies, please! You can boss me around, just one at a time!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Finally! A supervisor!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thank God I wore the underwear with the hole on the side.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If you're lucky, me, then this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen to your sister, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What are you talkin' about? Marge and I are goin' great.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It was during Happy Hour. Don't you want our baby to be happy?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How can something that applies to Bart apply to me? I'm so much older and wiser.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little... I'll teach you to say something that sounds similar!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You told me it was up to me if I wanted to go!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I am sick and tired of trying to decode you like you're some kind of human being separate from myself!!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Finally, we're gettin' somewhere.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hand me my suitcase, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,When you're older.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're saying it like it happens all the time. And by the way, the paint's a little faded on my parking spot. You call this a Platinum Club experience?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I've told you a thousand times, call me Homer!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Standard hotel boilerplate. It just says somebody died in this room in the last seventy-two hours.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it'll happen again, son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Knock yourself out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not again!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I had this idea years ago...but your mother wouldn't let me do it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shows how much she... knooooows! It's hurting my eyes!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know what we need? A classic ""kicked outta the house"" party. Now who's got a rockin' CD?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's it? Well, then let's ""power"" this party up!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This calls for decisive action -- like L.B.J.'s use of the period of mourning following the assassination to push through the Civil Rights Act.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The same way Hollywood does, by watching British movies!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Agreed, but to win back our women we need to make a grand romantic gesture.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,After we finish watching the movie.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I WROTE THIS SONG TO SAY I'M SORRY,,,,,
Homer Simpson,THE MELODY IS BY BEETHOVEN,,,,,
Homer Simpson,MARGE YOU WILL GET THE LAST PORK CHOP...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I promise to do the things I checked off within a year.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think it's a Terence Malick movie.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Finally, a kids' show that isn't trying to sell you something. Which reminds me, we need to order more rectangles.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Honey, this sounds like a noble experiment, but like prohibition, it will end in a hail of bullets.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm on it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If I buy you, why do I need all these books?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Spot the Hidden Objects.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, you're pretty pushy for a book I just met.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Gotcha! Candy cane in the umbrella stand -- oldest trick in the book... okay, let's see...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If they're not a trumpet or a rolling pin, then ""no.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, now to see if I can apply my book knowledge to the real world.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Got 'em!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sure, what do I care?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whatever you say, sir.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sometimes it's just so nice to have a man take charge.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Grownups have their reasons!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I just did that!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, can I get a subscription to Highlights Magazine?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where does it say that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Highlights... ""for...""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Leave it to me...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Earring!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,...thimble from Monopoly game...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,...twenty-five dollar casino chip...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,...the smallest nesting doll!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just my honey pie.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wanna split it while we snuggle?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Licking the wrapper.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Waldo. Waldo. Waldo.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We'll get those kids back.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Because we just bought them new shoes!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Waldo. Waldo.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How many kids will jazz corrupt?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No. I'm sorry. It's... wait a minute.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We've found what we're looking for.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sure, they could be here. Who knows?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Your hair is growing back! Tell me your secret!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,There's always a catch.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's gonna be ""yes,"" but don't rush me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, promise you will never look like me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little! That's not a heartwarming thing to end on!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't believe you're reading when there's so much great stuff on TV.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Writing is for bathroom walls, and acting is for getting out of DUI's. The only reason TV exists is for reality shows about white-trash scuzzbags doing sub-human, made-up jobs.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ooo! Jail music!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll give it one marathon.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No one feels out a unit like CJ! Not Bubba, not Debbie and Danny, no one!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"High-five me, Marge!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Too late!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We're gonna get rich off the poor and forgetful! And dead people.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There's other P.O.s? Uh-oh, better put on my game shades.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,One thousand dollars!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"In the money game, cash is king.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You won't be laughing when these boxes are full of priceless treasures.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Feather boas?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Tights? Robes? This stupid locker must have belonged to some old lady.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why would my man-dad have lady stuff?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Beefcake mags?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's insane! My dad was married to a woman... who left him... because he ignored her needs for decades. My gay dad is gay for gays.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Those are pretty cute...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"My dad's always been so angry. Maybe if we help him be who he is, he'll finally be happy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah. Gay rights are human rights, baby.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's okay, Dad. We know the truth, and we love you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just admit who you are, and you can find new love.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No fatties!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If I can't find my father a man to kiss and cuddle, then I've failed as a son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then how do you explain this?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look at all this wrestling stuff.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's wrong?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You were a world-famous wrestler? Spill the beans, old man. Word beans!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Those things?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know. Should I really let the men who ruined my past and present hang out with the kid who's going to ruin my future?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Text me the choices.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Apparently, old folks homes are full of people that used to be things. Just like you and me. Swear to God.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Heel? Oh no, tell me you are not trying to be like Grampa!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No I don't. If you pray to Superman.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Your grandfather is super lame! I mean, if he wasn't a terrible father, what's my excuse for this?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You grandson-ruining fiend! Look what your ""number one fan"" did at show and tell!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's found footage!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How are you a winner? You're cheating in a fake sport!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart cannot be an old-time wrestler! As your inattentive son, and your incompetent employee, I forbid it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why does everything I forbid always happen?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"He's taking on Mean Man Monty! Go get him, Honest Abe!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I wish Grampa was my dad.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey Flanders. Can I borrow some sugar?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A little cream?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now if you could make with some bacon and eggs, I'll be on my way.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are your kids gonna be there?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, police? I'd like to report a buzz-kill in progress.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This room just got a whole lot cooler.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look at the size of that bird! I'd go Henry the Eighth on those drumsticks.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, it's medicinal. We had a pain in our neck.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I didn't know you were left-handed.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But the storytelling is finally catching up to the technology.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What about Christian Archie comics?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here, I'll get you started. Hail Superman, wearing tights, Clark Kent be thy name... one nation, under Zod...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Give him one of your famous murmurs, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Your famous murmur. You know .,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, Flanders. Punch my eye, destroy my marriage. Now just pull the plug and let me die.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I hate unions. There's this guy at my plant, caused three meltdowns and he still keeps his job.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah. I say ""union"" you say ""power""! Union...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Union!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you're really dogging it on the ""power."" But don't worry, because of the union, you're safe. So, just what are you gonna do for our daughter?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We really appreciate that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Flanders?! How'd you get in here? This place is a highly-sensitive area.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I don't go to where you work and read the bible to you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just what do you want?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, you went and hired a law firm, eh? That's pretty aggressive.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, man. What's the catch?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmm...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm not punching you, Flanders.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Because if I hit you back, we'll be even. But if I don't hit you, that makes me the better man. And I'm liking the way that feels.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's not for me to judge, Ned because... I am the better man!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Better man, comin' through... way-better-better, way-better-better zing!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You may be the sweater man, but Homer is the better man.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I didn't know you were left-handed.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fear not, people. I will lead you safely across.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Help me, Flanders!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What's wrong, Sweetie?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Even after we came to school?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Every time I try to fix things it just makes things worse. But I'm gonna fix this!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think I have an idea.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Flanders, I've come to forgive you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But, there is one condition...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't wanna hit you. I want your wife.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"To elaborate, I want your wife, the teacher, to help get rid of Lisa's substitute...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"How much plutonium do you want? Gotta warn you, it might take me twenty minutes to get it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is praying?! Let me outta here!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Help me God!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't like the sound of that funeral march.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay! I'll pay for your damn band candy! What was it, seventeen hundred dollars?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now do me wearing a sombrero!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now have me sleeping under a cactus!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All too well.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, if there's one thing I've learned as a defendant, and a juror, it's... stay out of the courtroom! It's so frickin' boring! Run, boy! I'll create a distraction!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You gotta be kiddin'.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's amazing how much exercise I've gotten from those words.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Keep it under your hat, guys, but I've got a date with a married woman.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Her husband's gonna be there too.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Give up? It's Marge -- I'm having a lunch date with my wife.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Date with my wife.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,When we got married I promised you a life full of romance. Now here it is.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, this is amazing. I never realized some restaurants are better than others.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Beats drowning.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What? What? You're interesting. Why would you say that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Words hurt, you know.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Maybe it's time for a visit from Wally, the Kissing Walrus.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I thought this was an innocuous lunch but it's become terribly ocuous.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Conversation, conversation... you look great.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And uh, how was your day?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You can't spell ""lousy"" without ""us.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, wait!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen, we swore we'd never go to sleep angry at each other.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, you didn't have two beers with your lunch.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my God! A marriage so perfect that I could take it for granted for years, suddenly explodes. What do I do?! What do I do?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I like that picture of the sneaker with wings. I'm gonna flee!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where's an electric sidewalk when you need one?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fleeing didn't work. I have no choice. I will have to... do whatever the other thing was!!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm fightin' for ya, babe. Fighting like I would for the last slice of cold pizza in the box. And to show you how serious I am...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,From the place beside the gas station!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge was so happy when I made those promises. What changed?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"How do I win Marge over? I could get her kids to like me! No, that ship has sailed.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hm. Would it make a woman happy to do the things she asked you to do?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think it would!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Searchy? Where can I find brake fluid?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That was yesterday.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where can I find a better voice-activated search machine?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't please any woman.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, let's see how straight it is.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What have I told you about comical entrances?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm planing down that door that always sticks. I put training wheels on Bart's bike, and made an appointment with the dermatologist to see about my slowly-receding hairline.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, my love?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh. Well, you know how in the Special Olympics they give medals just for showing up?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'd like a lot of food, and for this to be the last decision I have to make.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're all I have left. I trust you completely.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay... this should do it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marriage is so tough. Every second it could explode catastrophically. Makes me not want to come home from my job at the nuclear plant.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Omakase? Where have I heard that word before?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow. Wow. This is the most delicious analogy I've ever eaten. I need to share this insight with Marge. Put this in your finest Styrofoam!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Once again, by eating alone I have saved my marriage.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"For reasons I forgot in the car, this sushi represents our marriage. But what I know for sure, is that I want to share it with you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, at least you don't have to suffer, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe, can you think of a way to please a woman that starts with ""f""?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! I'll woo her with woo-hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hello dere!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The minister's wife? What are you here for?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen pal, this may sound kinda kinky, but I would like to, uh, please my wife.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I think I could give it a shot what-what, guvnah. Bob's your uncle.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh Marge! Come to the ga-rage! You know it'll be good 'cause I'm saying it in a sing-song fash-ion!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just relax. Sit down. Not in that chair! It has no bottom!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Anger's a mood!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know. It's just that you always say we should try new things. But I thought snuggle clamps just might rekindle...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Quick! Call the Procter and Gamble help line!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What does that mean?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's behind the Dingle Swing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, you forgive me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, honey. So you're not cool with any of the toys?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Which one?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What size batteries.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ooh! How many?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Holy moly!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really? You wanna throw something out just because it's a little old?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No need. I already went online and ordered a new couch just like the old one.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And you know, Marge, those salespeople weren't really our friends.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They charged a deposit!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's right, sweetie. It always comes from corporate.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ew! Just hearing about them makes me itch.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Funny how the brain does that, huh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The brain is so stupid.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Probably one of Bart's dirty friends! Boy, why are your friends so dirty?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,TouchÃ©.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute! This has oats in it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, a nose-hair trimmer!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Padre, can I be honest with you? I've sucked every church book ribbon there is hoping to find one made of cherry. But there isn't.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And if it's such a ""Good Book,"" how come there's no blurbs on the back? Not even David Sedaris? And he'll flack anything!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Seriously, ""Pews?""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Deacon? Is that like one of those weird Catholic Priest things?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, now we're talkin'. But why me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well I'm not one for taking new jobs on a whim. But as we say in the snow plow business, ""I'm your astronaut""!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just looking for the bathroom.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But this paper towel feels so good.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That would save us several hundred bucks.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Right, um, I don't understand, Lisa, we let you get up early to watch the Royal Wedding!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Since when?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's an honor, sir.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lost sheep! Yes! Sis boom bah!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Church bulletin? Church bulletin? Find out in whose loving memory this week's service is. The answer may shock you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, for the record, I hated the building, the people in it and the spirit it represented. I never hated the church itself. And now, finally, I believe in something bigger than myself.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...! lamb... mustn't... kill own son... only God can do that...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Church bulletin? Church bulletin? Church--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Someone finally took one!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,DAY BY DAY... DAY BY DAY... THE DEACON'S JOB... IS PRETTY OKAY... PRETTY OKAAAY... I'M GOING TO BE A DEACON... DAY BY DAY... I'M ALREADY A DEACON... DAY BY DAY...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, I'd love to, but... I'm a deacon now. My butt's place is in my pants.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the--?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Calm yourselves! In times like this, there's one almighty being we can put our faith in... Reverend Hooper.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,His boringness saved us all...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Compliments of the deacon!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,DAY BY DAY / DAY BY DAY / I'VE GOT THREE KIDS / AND TWO ARE OKAY / TWO ARE OKAY! / ONE OF THEM IS THE BABY / THE SMART ONE IS MINE MAYBE / I HOPE THE BOY GETS RABIES / DAY BY DAY BY DAY / DAY BY DAY... / OH I PRAY / DAY BY DAY BY DAY BY DAAAY!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh boy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is that the radon detector?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you're deleting the two thousand nine Oscar Red Carpet! There were some awesome dresses! And quite a few dis-as-ters.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I can't part with a single one of my ""Hoarders""! Hands off my episodes of ""Episodes,"" and if you delete ""Revenge""...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,...so I stayed up for the last eighty-seven hours watching all my shows.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nothin's gonna delete these!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I know C.P.R.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I took a class where you do chest compressions to a Bee Gees song.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,HOW DEEP IS YOUR LOVE... HOW DEEP IS YOUR LOVE...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Too on the nose. I REALLY NEED TO LEARN / 'CAUSE WE'RE LIVING IN A WORLD OF FOOLS...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now wait a minute. Gotta make sure you're okay. Who's the president now?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He's back!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The woman I love!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, uh, I was just leaving, but Moe... had an accident.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, Moe, one more surprise.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"They're like a wedding ring, I can't take them off anymore.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Got anything for a man my size?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Tent, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No tents, no barrels, no kiddy pools. Thank you, fashion police.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thank God I'm not in the shower!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The crows weren't racist -- the people who drew them were.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid clog...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My head hairs! I'm bald!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get-- Get get in there...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, dammit!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is it that obvious?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My wife has never seen my head naked. Maybe I should wear a cowboy hat.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Those two hairs were what was left of my youth, Moe.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Those royal elephants have trainers to keep 'em in shape. Average schmoe like me, forget it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sausage fingers!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay guys, here's the deal -- I've gone bald.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What are you talking about?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The way you put it, it sounds so perfect, but it's not.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's not even noon.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who are you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Are you my guardian angel? If so, can you turn a pumpkin into a chariot? Even a used Camry would be okay.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're cool with it? I haven't even told my wife.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, is that what your wife did?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Which one?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, your generation won't have any dreams come true.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I have something to show you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, it's something else.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hair, no hair, I don't really think about it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Tell me about it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Marge, when you hold me like that...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,To me it's legs versus boobs.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the--? Change the channel? But I'm watching soft-core tennis!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the hell is that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Did she really say that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You like this now? What about ""Planet Jackson and the Earth Brigade?""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You did it, baby. You promised no fun and you delivered.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Guys, this science exhibit that told me how stupid it is to play the lottery.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you nuts? You can't win if you don't play.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Four lucky numbers for four best friends.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And I'm sixty-nine, because people always laugh when you say sixty-nine. No one knows why.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll get mini-dumpsters of wings from Garbage Wings!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,To the best feeling in the world -- money.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Guys, I got big plans for these winnings. I'm going to build... a swimming pool.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So freaking far in the ground, baby.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, that's probably what happened.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I hope our friend wasn't in an accident.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I wasn't thinking that! Carl's our good friend.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The power of friendship is so amazing, I don't feel at all suspicious of Carl.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Our money's gone.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Guys, I think we might need a new song. FOUR BEST FRIENDS WHO NE-VER QUAR-REL",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't think so -- his travel neck pillow's gone from its pedestal...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's this? ""I've gone home. Goodbye forever, Carl Carlson.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know, me too. It's the ultimate screw-over.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, you know how dudes are. We don't go digging into the past. We talk about guy stuff.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute! Something's reflected in the lenses of Carl's sunglasses!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I just need to get closer.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He's looking at a geyser! And there's a sign in front of it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's too small to read.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I thought it was Superman's Superman-cave.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fifty bucks per bag? I guess I'm only bringing one guitar on this revenge trip.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Baby... I'm going for us. That money is gonna dig us a swimming pool that'll take our broken family and make it whole.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've already taken care of that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This is funny, it says here Iceland is green, and Greenland is icy. The Vikings switched the names to trick everybody.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just say he's black, Moe.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How do you know about Carl's family?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, this is it, Carl's family home. Twenty-two...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, phew, oh, that's a lot of letters.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The gates are locked.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, dammit, we lost him!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's no use. We're perfectly matched.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We did it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Give us some answers, or you'll get a mouthful of rotten shark fermented in its own urine.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Lenny.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the hell is this?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Carl. It's World War II all over again -- America kicks Iceland's ass.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Guys, do you think Carl was right? What if we're not real friends? Maybe we are just lonely guys who do... guy stuff...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Put the noodles in the shed. There isn't gonna be a swimming pool.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Carl spent all our money on this stupid page from a stupid saga.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, we won't know that till after.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But how can we learn to read ancient Icelandic?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Forvitinn.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You can't not do it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, let's see what this thing says.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""When the barbarian invaders came, the Carlsons met them with their weapons ready""...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...""weapons which they immediately threw down in surrender. The Carlsons then let the barbarians in the back gate and joined in the sacking, the looting...and the volcano-ing of the village elders.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The Carlsons then wrote down this saga so no one would ever forget their treachery and cowardice.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Carl's family was even worse than people thought.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yieg err meth frau-baii-rr-a hoo-g-minn-d.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Attention everyone in Iceland! We have an important announcement!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is this everyone?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I've learned something about the people of Iceland. You've endured barbarian invasions, total financial collapse, and a lesbian prime minister.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You've managed to survive on a craphole island that looks like the moon and smells like rotten eggs. And to do that, you have to be stubborn.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I ask you to put aside your stubbornness while I tell you about Carl Carlson...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It doesn't matter what happened a thousand years ago. For Carl Carlson's honor has been redeemed by the deeds of Carl Carlson.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And when he brings a six-pack to my house, he doesn't take the extras home with him. Carl Carlson leaves them in the fridge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aww... thanks, Flanders. Gotta warn ya, he doesn't talk much.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We don't get together to share our emotions. We get together to escape them.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay everyone, get ready to see your brand new...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,...keg-pools!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fine, I'm going home.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And we're more in love than ever. In your face, people who said it wouldn't last a year!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Better clean that off.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You have a great day, ma'am.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He's not your daddy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll teach you to speak in complete sentences.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But first, m'lady, let me escort you to Heaven -- the fancy Swiss chocolate store on level three!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just call me Borders Books, 'cause I'll always be here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yep, we've got something money can't buy - love on a train. And I promise each anniversary will be better and better...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But somehow our anniversaries didn't get better than that first one on the train.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, just like we did with Bart. Anyway, this year I'm gonna recreate our magical first anniversary, ending with a romantic ride on that...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why are you taking away the train?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kids, I've only had three great ideas: marrying your mother, using a hot dog as a straw, and this romantic train ride anniversary. Sir, I need this train!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,She won't see it like this. I'll make this train look as beautiful as it did when this mall was young.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You stay away from my kids unless you're driving them to school!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, we're still on for tomorrow night.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what could be cooler than a choo-choo with lollipops on it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Shake it off kids, they're just jealous!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,There's no such place!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... anniversary? That comin' up?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I am focused on this like a laser. ""Laser."" That's a funny word. It's just ""loser"" with an ""a."" And speaking of losers, I've lost my train of thought. Oh, and speaking of trains, wait till you see--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The surprise is safe! The expression on her face will be priceless!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Currently: zero.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, Moe. When Marge is asleep, I'll sneak back.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, those Yelp reviews don't write themselves. Did you know a well-placed one star can destroy a mom and pop hardware in nothing flat?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um, Marge, I have to go.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All worth it for Marge!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'VE BEEN WORKIN' ON THE RAILROAD...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Because it's in the public domain?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, uh, I'd better take this. Y'see, Moe's been depressed and needs to hear a friendly voice. Why the hell are you calling me at home, you moron?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, all right, I'll be right there!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, oh boy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I threw my back out. Can you please refill this prescription right away?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's in Drugtown. Not the nice part.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And what better way to spend it than commemorating the glorious words you spoke ten years ago: ""for worse.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's working. She's gone! All right, everyone, magically appear!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, Moe. Great shrub costume.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You guys are the best. I just want you to know when I'm holding Marge in my arms tonight, I'll be thinking of all of you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You think we'll last twenty-five years?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hall and Oates? What's going on here?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Costume drama or naughty comedy?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You just dodged a bullet, Mister Sugarpants.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Honey... just what was going on with you and that guy?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh baby, that's all I needed to hear.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How did we get here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,BUT WHEN MARGE WENT BOO HOO / I WAS BUILDING A CHOO-CHOO...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,YOU DESERVE WHAT YOU GET...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay. I'm ready for the Nuclear Workers Convention! It's a little sad. The guys who did the funny skit last year well, they're all very sick.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Even better, I never unpacked from the time we went to Hawaii.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, my lava's almost cooled!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A whole weekend away from my family. I can't believe I have to miss taking the kids to buy gym uniforms. Send me a picture?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now look guys, we are here for one important reason: to get free swag.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,SWAG! I'M GONNA GRAB FOREVER / STUFF THAT I REALLY DON'T NEED / SWAG!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'M GONNA HAVE FORTY KEY CHAINS! / AND I DON'T EVEN HAVE FORTY KEYS! / SWAG!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"MORE FREE STUFF, MORE FREE STUFF, MORE FREE STUFF, MORE FREE STUFF...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"MORE FREE STUFF, MORE FREE STUFF, MORE FREE STUFF...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I still haven't forgiven you for putting that dead goat in my bed!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll kill you, you son of a--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,To texting!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, everyone.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I overslept, lost my cell phone, missed my flight.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,All the payphones at the airport were replaced by self-serve yogurt. I had all the cookie dough toppings a man could want.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, back to normal.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"They're called ""Superoos,"" son. With pictures of the cast of ""The Expendables"".",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That kind of small scale violence solves nothing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, I'll pass on the pork.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll just enjoy these green beans with slivered almonds. Mmm, so slivered.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A napkin.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can I just get a glass of water?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I changed in Boise. I'm not sure a man who eats right and doesn't drink can be good in bed.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're so beautiful when I cut you off in the middle of a question.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Moving my body.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How y'all doin'?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If you are a cat, prove it. Do you hate Mondays like Garfield?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And do you love lasagna... like me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay then.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hanging up the receiver, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How much did you say?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So I heard half of nothing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lisa. I'll miss you when this is all over.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This conversation.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,See you on the other side.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Of the house. Where the fireplace is. We're toasting marshmallows. Marshmallows.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What was the first one again?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I'm the one in bed with two beautiful women.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,In a breaking and entering kind of way.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Let's just say I've got to get to work on time. And if you knew me, you'd know just how odd that sounds.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No one.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,HEERE'S THE CLIMAX,,,,,
Homer Simpson,WHAT EVERYTHING'S BEEN BUILDING TOOOO /,,,,,
Homer Simpson,HOPE IT PAYS OFF FOR YOUUU...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Weird thing under a tarp.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You laugh now but you won't be laughing soon.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How'd you get in here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm not blowing up the plant. Just harmlessly stopping it from doing more damage to Mother Earth.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, my terrorist masters are always talking about you, Lisa.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I missed my flight so I got in a van...with some eco-friendly activists. They wanted gas, grass or ass and brother, I had the ass.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They taught me something I found shocking: pigs aren't happy to be made into pork chops. This t-shirt lied to me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And they also gave me an alcohol detox.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've been listening to this song for three days and it's only the end of the first verse!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, I've never prayed to a city in my life, and if I did, it would be Hershey, Pennsylvania. I was kneeling on the Affirmation Rug they gave me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,See?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ow, this rug is hard on my knees. Ow, this rug is hard on my knees. Ow, this rug is hard on my knees.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, the most horrible truth of all is the plant where I work poisons our water and our air.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, sweetie, you've told me a thousand things a million times. Even with a brain the size of a dinosaur's, I couldn't take that in.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Anyhoo, this canister is full of spoiled milk and utility-grade chicken.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Both sold to me by Apu this morning.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"When I release it into the A. C. system, it'll stink up the plant forever.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just like when I smell up the toilet.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, hey, it's not what you think, Lou. Lou! Lou! Lou! Lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We sure did.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I was just up late watching a movie. Something with... William Holden and--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A beer from the sky! It's a sign!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shut up.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little... I'll teach you to make medical history!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oops.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All good.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey boy, since you don't need a bedroom any more, I finally get my man cave.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Man cave! Everyone's welcome to my man cave!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Great... oh, and I have this ""two heads for one"" coupon.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How 'bout this one?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,One random disorder free with every schizophrenia.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Should've chopped off Bart's head long ago.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, mix-ins!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Son-of-a!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,THIS IS THE SONG THAT YOU HEAR AT THE CIRCUS / SUNG BY A GUY THAT YOU SEE AT THE CIRCUS...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge! Get away from those freaks! You belong to me! The dumb, hairless brute!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Taste the strength of your fiancÃ©!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, they knew what they were getting into when their parents sold them to the circus.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,With an emerald that big I could buy anything -- a jalopy! An icebox! A steamer trunk full of fedoras! But how do I get my hands on it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm an idiot! Of course! I get Marge to marry Moe, then I kill Moe, then she gets the ring, then I marry her, and the ring is mine. And the brilliance of my plan is its simplicity!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're gonna be sorry you said that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Marge, you wanna marry Moe?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The poor lonely fellow is about to die.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Let me worry about how. But you know, you could make his last day a happy one. And the ring is just the icing on the cake.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The ring that'll get me outta this lousy circus and into a good circus. Now let's get you married.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But won't you be jealous, my love?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dear, I am not the jealous type. And from you, I have learned to feel compassion for these disgustos.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ho ho ho! A very small time!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Those are strange things to say, but a wedding is no place to worry about threats from the bride's former lover. Now, the toast...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"To you, Marge. Now you are one of us.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,One of us! Gooble goo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Trying to kill Moe so we'll get his emerald. By the way, I haven't checked, but emeralds are valuable, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Strong man, Moe may be ugly on the outside, but inside, you are the true monster. Leave my trailer forever!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're rejecting me? But I'm in the best shape anyone is, in the nineteen thirties.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the hell does gooble goo mean?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You killed Burnsum? Now who is gonna say ""Step right up""?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is exactly why circus attendance is plummeting!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...and that, kids, is how I met your mother.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,People called him the sixth Simpson. Not sure why.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,GET DOWN / EVERYBODY'S GONNA LEAVE THEIR SEAT,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man, this is the weirdest pregnancy craving ever.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Overstay my welcome for forty years?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm thinking about it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's the coolest bowling ball I've ever seen.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, Bear Stearns? I'd like to sell all my Apple stock so I can buy a fancy bowling ball. You heard me. Technology is a fad. Heavy blue balls are the future.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You cost me a piece of all of that!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, don't cry.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll bet a rich man like you has no regrets at all.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You misheard that on purpose!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um... it says I should give you ""lumbar support."" Better go to the lumberyard...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey book, are you expecting this?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And while I'm at it... burn dumb helpful books!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That is a good fire.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We've had some good times.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And you sat on the gas pedal when my foot fell asleep. So I'm gettin' you shined up nice.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think I just might have what you're looking for.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Today I'm glad that I sold that stock.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why does everyone know?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My boy's okay!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And together we are.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll handle this. ""Dear Weirdo, pick up weirdo kid."" And send.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the?! If this kid's Dad isn't here in one second he's going in the garbage can.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Once again, cats have it better.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look at me, I'm afraid of dying!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"NO DREAM WILL COME TRUE,",,,,,
Homer Simpson,YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm tired of livin' once.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, if you don't mind, I'm gonna quit complaining about my life and start wallowing in the past.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My old pen pal from Spain. Eduardo.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Back in fifth grade, you either had to write to a foreigner or a prisoner. I picked a foreigner because the prisoners wrote back too fast. We'd write each other with our dreams of the future...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I was gonna be King of Cheeseburger Mountain. Did I change or did they stop making mountains out of cheeseburgers? Probably a little bit of both.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So sad.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If you're my wife's secret lover, come in. There's nothing I can do for her anymore.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Eduardo?! Is it really you? why are you here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm Homer Simpson!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I wish.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What happened to us, Eduardo? We had so many things we were going to do.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, well listen, pal. I have my treasure: my wife and my children.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do you have a disrespectful son who calls you by your first name?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Did you just fart, sir.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really? Now? I have two pizzas coming. I wanted to see who would get here first.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why are you doing this? Wait. Are you in love with me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo-hoo! I'm an attractive concept like Liberty!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,One more ride?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't know what it is about having all my dreams fulfilled, but I feel great.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That doesn't sound happy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mmm, melon collie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, what was your childhood dream?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let's do it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We do that every night! Come on! Jump on the bed!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Eduardo. I haven't felt this good in years. You're like the Tooth Fairy except you don't collect human bones.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So that's it? All my dreams, lived?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, we've gotta do it! I never leave a job unfinished. It's as true now as that week I worked on the high school yearbook. So much infighting. I had to get outta there!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The editor put in like six pictures of this girl 'cause she was his girlfriend.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um, actually, my hero was the actress who provided Rocky's voice, June Foray. A true legend in the voiceover community. I'm just gonna stay on the plane and think about her influence.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm doing it! I'm flying like the squirrel I always knew I was.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, indigo!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Majestic eagle... just like me, unashamed of his baldness.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So beautiful.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, he probably sees a mouse he wants to tear in half.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid tallest building in Springfield!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, it was so beautiful! I went faster than the speed of sound.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No matter what, Homer Simpson has done it. And soon I hope I remember who Homer Simpson is and his relationship to me. But I have no regrets. In fact, all this has given me a sense of calm I've never had before.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can you give me the morphine forever?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Eduardo? Eduardo! Eduardo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh. It was all just a dream.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah. Great. Um... Do I drop you at the curb or do I have to park and walk you in?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No time for breakfast, Marge. Just give me a banana.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, listen... I have to work late tonight.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's a tough economy. Money doesn't grow on trees.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It grows on threes!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nice sunglasses, Lenny.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'd better call it a night, guys. I don't want to take any more of your money.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Who's president now, Alexander Hamilton?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Timing the elevators, eh? Smart.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay, no worries.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Everyone has a cellphone. Mine's at home.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Everything will be fine... um... Oh you, uh, you like movies? This reminds me of that scene in ""Alien.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The scene where she escapes with the cat at the end.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, he was just here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You like lies? Here's a few: college is expensive but it's worth it...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay Homer, remember your Lamaze training...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, wow, that does feel good. Oh no, I think it's coming. I haven't even picked a name yet!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I didn't!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um... I don't know how to tell you this, but your baby doesn't have any legs--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh! Oh wait, there's more!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's a dude! And he's uncut! Very Euro! Now, hug your mommy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"For unto you is born this day, in this elevator, inspected in August 2009, a baby.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, that guy didn't even look over once.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Miraculous.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mothers are so awesome.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good game, everyone. I never dreamed a night where you'd discovered I was cheating and beat the crap outta me could end on such an up note.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Gretchen!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Good as new. And thanks for loaning me your sweater for the ride home. It may be a little stretched out.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow. So now there's two things named after me -- a baby, and a law banning air horns after three a.m.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, that's sweet.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um, hey... I was just driving by... with some baby stuff we didn't need and uh...here's some diapers Maggie's too big for, an incredible educational toy I forgot to give Bart...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, I'd love to help, but I did kind of have plans for tonight...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think I'll be good tonight and stay in with you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where's Hoju? Where's Hoju? Where's Hoju?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where's Hoju? Where's Hojuuu?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Kids blow up so fast.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no, I'm shopping for Homer Junior, a baby I delivered in an elevator the night I pretended to go to work but was really playing poker!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yes, I am shopping for Maggie, our baby together, so this looks perfectly innocent.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you know how the first few weeks are: sleep deprived, walking around in a fog...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um, November.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Excuse me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh baby!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh baby, shake it! Homer like!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Shake it! Now, roll over on your tummy, just like I taught you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Tell me what a cow says!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My other baby mama!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, it's not what you think!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it's cool. We did it in an elevator.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But you're also the housekeeper, so it's all good.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I haven't had a drink for a week.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's true. Even the other guy in the elevator. He's right here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Goodbye, Homer Junior. I guess you're the man of the house now. And never forget, even though the mortgage is due on the first you can usually wait till the seventeenth.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Exactly. You always said charity begins at home -- but not which home.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And now to sing you a lullaby my father sung to me:,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"SLEEP, SLEEP SLEEP SLEEP / SLEEP SLEEP / SLEEP, SLEEP SLEEP SLEEP SLEEP SLEEP!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh man, I really overdid it tonight.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No. I'm exhausted from ""Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes. Knees and toes."" It's the ""toes"" that get ya, Marge. It's the toes...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Way ahead of you, Marge. I am taking all four of my kids to the zoo tomorrow.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes. We'll be back by three. Homer has a very tight nap schedule.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I was talking about myself in the third person.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I wanted you all to be happy together, so I brought you to the zoo where all the animals live in harmony.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, oh oh oh! Now Maggie, we don't hurt each other in this family.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why you little... I'll give you a goodnight kiss you'll never forget! C'mere, you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can I just say goodbye to him quick?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, I know what'll cheer you kids up. Seeing me out-monkey the monkeys.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I have a soul and you guys don't!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look! Shiny keys! Jingle jangle!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid monkeys.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm sorry, Homer Junior. You'll occupy an idealized place in my heart that no one can never quite fill.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, I've got to impart all my fatherly advice in this one walk. The sky is blue, but no one really knows why. Don't believe what they tell you. Girls are great and terrible at the same time. Get used to it. And, most importantly-- Oops, we're here. You'll have to figure it out on your own.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, little fella. One day I'll be that guy who comes to your wedding, makes you feel a little weird, and then runs away.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Who's Chase?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You didn't tell me he was a soldier.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um, he likes it if you tickle his toes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But n-n-n-nurture...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I guess this is it, little guy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The most beautiful words a father can hear.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I do.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hi Maggie, if you could talk, I know you'd have a few choice words for me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You want me to take care of your dolly?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's the sweetest thing any baby has ever done for me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's this marching band have to do with Homer Junior? What? There were cheerleaders in our house? And nobody told me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, spaghetti.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Y'ello! Lisa, you got a call from someone named Isabel.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"May I ask what this is regarding? Oooh, a budding new friendship? Oooh! Boy, how come you can't get a new friend?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, eighties party! Where's the beef? Tear down that wall! Because I think the beef is behind that wall!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now get up here, boy! We're gonna do the Super Bowl Shuffle.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine. You're Mike Singletary. Enjoy your mediocre coaching career.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,MY NAME IS HOMER / I'M A REAL FULL BACK / GONNA RUN THAT BALL / DON'T WANT NO FLACK...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You used to be fun.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's our girl.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What your mother is trying to say is we don't think you can be good that long.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What your mother is trying to say is--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Get real, ding dong! You've already done so much bad stuff, Skinner's never going to let you on that boat.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I love Bart as much as you do but actually not. And that kid cannot go one week without getting in trouble. Now if you'd be so kind as to start my car for me, I'm going to Moe's.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ooh! Thank you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Come on.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, boy. At times like this there's not much you can say... especially if you don't know what happened...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Really? Hey, I bet that submarine isn't so fun anyway.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"As I always say, don't get mad, get dinner. Then get even. With Skinner.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes. What's Skinner's weakness?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Good. We can use that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute... I knew you were a neat freak, Skinner. But you beat your rug till it bleeds?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm sure our town's police force will handle this competently.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let me handle things. Just go upstairs and shut the door. There are some things only a boy should see.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just call me ""The Cleaner.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The deed is done.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, you kill them, I get rid of them. That's always been our deal. But I do have one question: do you want the head?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well if you change your mind it'll be in my freezer. But only for a week. Got a lot of ice cream comin' in.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, I'm afraid it's time to start your new life. You'll be hunted... on the run... searching for the man who killed your mother, which is you. So avoid mirrors.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, but Dick Fiddler is allergic to potatoes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Someday I may have to fake my own death. And maybe you can help me with that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Someday soon. As in, what are you doing this Friday?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dick Fiddler!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, when you glare like that you look really beautiful.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, to that I say boo, humbug.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Global Warming, huh? By pure coincidence, every scientist was right!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Snow?! Snow!!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you know what this means, kids?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't have to pick up the dog poops!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh good. Marge remarried after I died. Wait a minute, I'm not dead. What's goin' on?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-uh! No way! I'm not sharing my bed with anybody except you! And maybe that guy. Lincoln-style. But that's it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I don't know. It won't seem like Christmas without opening up a giant credit card bill in January.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What the-- ""The Simpson Bed and Breakfast?"" I always wanted to stay in a place like this!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But Christmas is a special time. And I like to spend it in the warm embrace of watching football.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, this crazy scheme is the kind of impulsive behavior I want to encourage in you. I'm in. A hundred percent!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm on a break.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine. I'll drink alone.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The secret is don't read the comment cards.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I thought they were just gonna watch me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ho, ho, ho!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The pillow acted as a girdle.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You got me weed?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's great, sweetie. After all that time and hard work, I'll have... radishes?! It's the most hated part of salad, which is the most hated part of dinner! Radishes. Nothing but radishes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What? I'm saving them from the struggle of life.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Vegetables?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Shut up, Flanders!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh right, we're still doing that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, I'll drive you to the airport.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Where are my keys? Oh, right here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, boy. Monday morning chit chat at the water cooler. The only reason to have done stuff over the weekend.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait, you guys saw the new Radioactive Man sequel?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stop talking! I haven't seen it yet!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But what if I want some cooled water?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"They're talking about the movie! Hurry up, you idiot! No, no, don't stop! I'm sorry I got mad. I'll do that thing you like.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,AMAZING GRACE / HOW LOUD I SING / TO DROWN THE SPOILERS OUT... shut up. Shut up. Shut up!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, I've gotta go see the Radioactive Man movie before it gets totally ruined for me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If you all go, then I have to pay for a babysitter!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Emily-Beth? We can't afford Emily-Beth! She brings her own puppets!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bye bye, money!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Two adults, two kids, and one senior with the mind of a baby so he should be free.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"More snip, less lip.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, movie, you better be worth it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The motorcycle dudes are chicks!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I wonder what else is chicks?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey... they tricked us! That's a commercial! If I wanted to pay for commercials I can't skip, I'd sign up for Hulu Plus!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're shushing me! This guy's on his cell phone! She's texting! He's sexting! And that guy brought a baby to a nine o'clock movie!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What happened to the movies? First they got worse than TV, and now this!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Illegally download it? Is that legal?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, that was easy! All I had to do was click on--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bless you, boy. That was the greatest thing I've seen on a computer that I can talk about with you in the room. How did you know how to do that?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Guys, guys, I saw the Radioactive Man movie! Here's my ten favorite scenes from worst to best -- number ten: when what's his name did that stuff with those dudes. Number nine--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shut up shut up shut up!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Theaters? All I need to see this movie is a laptop and a website based in a country that's really just an offshore oil platform. Care to join me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Gentlemen, I am inspired to create a theater for the people -- an experience free of all the nuisances and gouging of modern day movie-going!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And best of all... we'll never have to sit through another annoying commercial again!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Welcome to ""Cinema Pirate-diso."" Tonight's movie is ""Life is Funny,"" directed by Judd Apatow. It's based on his life, starring his family, and adlibbed by his friends. So for the next three and a half hours, enjoy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I live it, he writes it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, what'd you think?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Let me? Uh, sweetheart, I downloaded it off the internet... illegally.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why should a regular guy like me have to spend fifteen bucks a ticket so studios can pay huge salaries to the Air Buds and Ray Liottas of the world?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I now present, direct from the computer of an angry editor at a special effects house, ""Cosmic Wars Episode Seven"".",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooo, mastermind.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,One of you turned me in? Who was it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Superintendent Chalmers, you never forgave me for that time we wore the same Hawaiian shirt to that luau!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Baby, promise me you'll find out who turned me in!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's probably someone I would never suspect! Never suspect!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Your moans of sympathy are all I have!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whoever did this will be haunted by unbearable guilt forever!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Forever!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What are you guys in for?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Movie piracy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I can't go back to jail! There's no shampoo, just soap!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, and why don't they make a sequel to ""Taken"" where the ""Hangover"" guys get taken and the only ones that can rescue them is ""Fast and Furious.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Consulate.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Consulates are regional offices, which serve the embassy in the capital.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thank you so much for sticking with me through all this. You're the greatest wife in the world.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You? How could you? You're my own flesh and blood!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Have you forgotten what you promised at our wedding -- to love and cherish, to aid and abet?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well you did. And they got laughs. Solid laughs.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All I ever had was you looking out for me. I've got nothin' now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know what, Judge Apatow... I do have something to say. These movie people may say I'm a pirate. But I'm just a man. A man who loved Hollywood too much. So I made my own rules, and fought the big guys who tried to destroy my way of life.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,At first my wife didn't believe in me. Maybe we forgot why we fell in love in the first place.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But when times seemed darkest, one minute ago, she was there, and gave me the strength and courage to fight for what I believe in.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"One family, against all odds, took on the system... and lost.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll sign with whoever can convince Channing Tatum to gain the most weight to play me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the hell is all this?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're pirating my movie?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The hell you are! Piracy is stealing! You're taking money out of my family's mouths.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh that's Hollywood fantasy. We live in the real world, where I have something called ""prof-it par-ti-ci-pa-tion"".",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now all of you go see my movie in the theater the day it opens! No bargain matinees!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And tell your friends it was great! Buy the stuff they advertise in the commercials before it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Homer in the movie wears Ask Body Spray and so should you. Don't ask! Do smell!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Up bup bup bup bup! What have we learned about not blindly supporting our husband?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And miss the back half of Jimmy Kimmel? That's when he experiments, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes I have! After the Oscars when he forces you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, buddy. I gotta get home and climb into bed with my loving wife.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge and I get along perfect. We're like George Burns and John Denver.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man, carrying these kids is hard on my back.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And now to Moe's.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart! Your comic vendor's here!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I will help you. As long as our bellies never touch again like they are right now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But why pick me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Aka ni taishte burei da! Yogore o yaburu!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Honki da yo?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not garbage, Americana.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We've talked about this, Marge. The hammock is a chore-free zone.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not a word.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're Kumiko's father? Welcome, sensei!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know, Mr. Sparkle.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I get that a lot too.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, she moved in with her boyfriend. Well, he's not a boy. He's immature, but fat and old.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I didn't tell you about the basement.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, discipline would imply I'm trying to make him better... so, are you married?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now that's disgusting. Wine made of rice?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why didn't I stop with the snake wine? Why did I drink the fish wine?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's going on here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you slimy little...!?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,As long as we keep drinking this.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,GLOWING RODS / GLOWING RODS / IT'S MAKING ME / WEAK AND DIZZY...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who told you that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I hope it's better than last year's lousy gift.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Glasses! Call Lenny!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lenny! It's me, Homer!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really? Don't you ever look up at the sky?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm watching videos of idiots wearing these glasses and not paying attention to the world around them.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look at these jerks.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll let you try them on, right after I decide if these videos are ""Funny Or Die"". Funny, funny, die, die, funny, funny but the guy died...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, a simple Sunday drive will reveal the hidden wonders of our hometown!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo-hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Springfield City Hall was built for the Spencer Tracy movie ""Meet Me At City Hall"". It was just a flat wall with nothing behind it for thirty years...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The rearview mirror was invented in nineteen eleven for just this reason...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"As early as eighteen fifty-nine, ""shut up"" was used to shut up...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Glasses, direct me to the nicest restaurant I can afford.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's it, I'm taking you off.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Reality!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, let's see what we've got here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Squeeze here. Rotate there. Pause for sweet talk. Oh glasses, you're so wonderful.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where's my money?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But the avatar looks just like you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Glasses, find me a great gift for my wife. Under five dollars.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Glasses, take me two minutes back in time.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,About the glasses...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm really sorry, and...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Only five pancakes? You're trying to kill me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, honey, I know these glasses are a radical new technology and should be worn in moderation. Isn't that right, glasses?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Anyway, I'm giving them up... ...to whoever dares take them.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, everybody!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Carl, it's me! I'm here! Really here!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stop!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What! No one can live in a non-augmented reality! I need another pair of glasses!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um, Mr. Burns, sir? Can I get another pair of glasses? Maybe two pair. One for the beach house. Can I also get a beach house? Two beach houses...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Monitors?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the-- Burns gave us those glasses so he could spy on us!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is a violation of our human rights.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, so let's see what we can see!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Solitaire, top hats on eBay, Angry Birds fan fiction...guy doing really easy crossword puzzle...Lenny doing Carl's clown makeup.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,...someone's actually working...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maggie?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Awww... Wait a minute... since Marge is wearing my glasses, I can see everything she sees. Uh-uh, I shouldn't watch this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute. Marge said we were out of ice cream.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What else is Marge hiding from me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is she having an affair?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why isn't she having an affair?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mr. Burns!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, that's a compact-only space!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, who knew you were such a rebel? Now, let's learn more about my wife's secret life. Secrets which can only be good.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge is in therapy?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pale ales. Please.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not Marmaduke! Never Marmaduke!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marmaduke was horrible today! Also, Marge is in therapy and she didn't even tell me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Spied on her with a hidden camera. She thinks I'm selfish, she thinks I don't spend enough time with the kids...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I guess the only choice is to come clean and tell her what I know... and how I know.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe, that's great. How do you get your ideas?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, you do like your secrets, don't you, Marge?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, I'm here to check in for the three o'clock.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's ""Fake Name.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's ""Alias."" Du-uh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my God... Marge needs this. It lights her way through the dark path of marriage to me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No need. Everything's fine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, as long as I'm paying for the time...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ow! Where'd you learn to cut hair, idiot?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't need to know, Marge. You deserve to have your secrets.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, Marge. But first, well, I have something I need to tell you. Something I did you might be mad about, and rightly so.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo-hoo! I tried! Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah. And?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where's that cake now?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who bought it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Excuse me. I have to make a call.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, Hibbert's in surgery, but they're having him paged.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait, something's wrong. That's better.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry son, I only have twenties. And if God needs money, why doesn't he just write another Bible? The first one sold pretty well.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, son... but you have to pay me back.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do you have my money?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do you have my money?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Right, right, too soon. Do you have my money?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Seriously, do you have my money?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where's my money?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where's... my... mon... ey?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Where's my money? Do you have my money? Where is it? You know, if you had the money, I'm right here. Do you have the money?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Pressure's how you make your beloved diamonds, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Quit pressuring me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What? Did you owe me some money?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you've said it twice, Marge. You're in pretty deep.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ten minute rule.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sit. Sit. Sit! Sit! SIT!!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't know what that is, but it's not sitting!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I know what that means. There comes a time when a boy sneaks his first beer. Finally! I was beginning to think that kid was a teetotaler.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"More like ""at your six-pack,"" am I right? It's okay if you need to take a little nap.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Because you're so drunk you can barely keep it together!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But it does sound like the kind of lie you'd make up after the first time you got blitzed.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's even better than I thought... you've found your Moe Szyslak! In just a few short years you'll be getting your version of baked on your version of pot listening to your version of Journey.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's he doing?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay. In your terms, points are like mice.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't interrupt! I just thought it would be nice if we shared an interest.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine! But the game is much more enjoyable if you understand it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, the Eagles and the Falcons. Tell me you're not interested in that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I could fly too if I didn't have a wife and three kids!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,At least someone in this family is using them.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, listen, boy... maybe you should spend more time with your old best friend. You know, Dweebler.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Because it's his home forever.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm eating the food of the future. Beep, boop. What is... love? Boop, beep, boop.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, campus! Do you have a statue of the founder I can stick a funny hat on?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Go! Go! Go!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Real doctor or PhD?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sideshow Bob!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Overfed? I don't know this word.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine. I'll take you. They have this cool psych class at the campus I sat in on.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It doesn't matter. I'm taking it pass-fail.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's why I've got to get the marshmallows down fast.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I like how they cut them down from a hundred and forty characters to a more manageable twenty characters.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, teens can't control their urges. It's why there's never been a teenage President.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No. I'm saying you're wasting everyone's time. But it's a church thing, so that's a given.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen, you punks. If you can't handle the image of our naked bodies in the tender act of a-oo-ga, you should never have come to the basement of this holy place.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Never!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How dare you torture my children with Mozart!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I call all music Mozart!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If it's not final, who cares?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If it's important, they'll call back.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That man can't remember anything except our number!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"My contract clearly promised ""barely livable""!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh... I guess Grampa's coming home with us. Unless... what about that nice dog boarding place? The really good one, where they each have their own dog ""partner.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're right. Bad idea, bad idea... Should we just, y'know... drive by and take a look at the place? Bad idea, bad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Honey, Grampa is the closest thing I have to a father and I love him. But three octogenocerouses?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Speak for yourself. Glug-glug-glug. Chomp-chomp-chomp. Beeeeep. My lifestyle is my retirement plan.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh... c'mon, boy. Your job is to guide me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I mean down the stairs, you stupid kid!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You just wanna see your old man trip and fall! Well, sorry to disappoint you, lad, but, what the--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I've had it up to here with those freeloading wrinkle bags. They pee all night, they cry all day and every time they use the computer the font is huge!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Have you seen how he treats my Grampa? Never visits him. Never even acknowledges his existence.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay. You know, I love him too. In a manly way that never shows itself.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I can handle them from now on, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Gentlemen, I've been thinking. My glorious youth and beauty won't last forever. Someday, when the leaves have turned, and the moon has broken apart into chunks of floating cheese, I will be old.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm hoping we can find a way to coexist.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, never had breakfast at six in the morning before.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, when does the exercise start?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my God! This counts as exercise? I'm barely moving and I'm smelling Cinnebun. Sometimes you have to wait till you're thirty-eight to discover who you really are. I'm a seventy-nine-year-old man!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, okay! Um... I can't.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All you gals like chicken dinners, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Better turn up the heat.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Young lady, in my day...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You won't feel so bolloxed once my social security checks start coming.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Falsies.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my God! I know that kid! We've gotta help him!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine. Your generation did its part when it won World War Two and created the Rockford Files. I've got this one.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it is so hard running in sand.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No. No. I can't be old yet. I won't let the ravages of time catch up with me till I'm fifty-two!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm coming at you with all the power of a reverse mortgage!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now let's go home, son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We've got ten minutes between the kids falling asleep and the old guys waking up.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa ""wants"" ""a"" ""dot dot dot""...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Guinea pig?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa got to you. I don't know how, but she got to you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Emojis. Now she's gone too far.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Circle ""other.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boilerplate, boilerplate, boilerplate... we can skip all this litter box stuff... if pet becomes internet superstar, all rights revert to father... Sign here, here, initial here, one more over here, and... done.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The kid-parent contract -- unenforceable, yet you feel like you didn't completely cave.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You don't have children, do you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"She's gone, honey. She's gone.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,She thinks she's decided. Don't say a thing. Don't blow this!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fighting Tweakers rule!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Kettle corn... the heroin of the farmer's market.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sure we could go to a fancy gallery and spend a bunch of money. Or...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, these seem great. Oh, too bad someone used cello rosin.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know. How 'bout this poster of a really rockin' jukebox?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You know it's rockin' 'cause music notes are coming out of it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, to me, it looks like... garbage salad, but that's the great thing about art: everyone can have their own opinion about why it sucks.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You guys are crazy. I've never even heard of that guy. It's not like it was painted by Leonardo Da Vinci Code.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, ere's what makes art valuable: 1. Nudity. 2. Holograms. 3. Something terrible happening to Jesus.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nobody touch it! Bart, stop looking at it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, you'll wear it out!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Baby, you saw something in this painting, and you were right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Split it? Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whoa, whoa, whoa...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whoa, whoa, whoa...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... split it with them?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, they sold it to us. So now it's our painting. We can hang it on our wall, cut eyeholes in it to spy on people, or... sell it for lots of money which we keep.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This dude gets it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know what you're talking about. Hide the treasure!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Are they, Marge? If you think about it, aren't they really just the parents of a kid who happens to hang out with our kid?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I would feel: A). Happy for their good fortune, B). Proud to know rich people, and C). Grateful for an opportunity to learn from a mistake.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then they'll just be mad about the sixty-five percent that we're keeping!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you like kindness, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So even if we gave Kirk and Luann some of money, the knowledge of what they could have had will eat away at them, like piranhas devouring a wounded yeti.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Homer looks into Marge's eyes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's kinder never to tell them.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What'll it take to buy your silence?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay Milhouse, the guys in back are putting your new bike together.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I guess. You're funny! No wonder Lisa's in love with you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We had a deal. And now we've got nothing...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We were gonna treat you to dinner at an upscale chain restaurant and never explain why, but now forget it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's exactly how it is.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh it is.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that was cold, Luann. So cold! BRRRRR! SARCASTIC BRRRRRR!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Honey, there's something I wanna show you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't know whose this is. I found it next to the cash machine, and I've always kept it. Look at the balance.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"With that painting we could have what these people have. A money cushion. No more living paycheck to paycheck, one lost retainer away from the gutter.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's the cushion.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't worry. No one's gonna see this stupid show.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""You have no obligation to share the money from that painting."" Ooo, a support rock!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just close your eyes and think of the cushion.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The paddles, Marge! Look at the paddles!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Our cushion!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Excuse me, we're trying to find ""CafÃ© Artiste.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I guess I can't help but feel fully responsible.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What you need, my friend, is a Canadian Duff. Beauty, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, why does that chick think she owns the painting?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not your fault, man. Those parasailing guys take whatever they want.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, all I gotta do is take a quick ferry to Isla Verde, find CafÃ© Artiste, and they'll back up Kirk's story. That will prove the painting was his -- and now ours.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But our cushion...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I wish I knew how.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just remember, if your mother asks, I took you to a wine tasting.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's why she'll believe it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sounds delicious. It's not. Hey, a friend of mine, uh, bought a painting here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And that man sold it to me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That proves the painting is mine! And nothing can stop me from selling it and keeping all the money!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I love art!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Prove it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh... crap.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then why did the auction house say it was real?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now let's play human foosball!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What if I never liked the painting, and only wanted it for money?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, great. The painting is worthless...this was all for nothing. And when Marge finds out she's gonna kill me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,While you're at it... could you make me a couple more?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll pay you in Strupo...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Rockin',,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, it happened again!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Loser.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pathetic.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He makes me sick.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The trick is, wait several weeks.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm so glad I was forced to come.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,'CAUSE I'M A GRADE SCHOOL HERO / LISA NEVER LIES / I'M A GRADE SCHOOL HERO / AND HEROES NEVER DIE / JUST ONE GUITAR! SLUNG WAY DOWN LOW / YEAH ONE GUITAR! / WHERE DID MY LAWNMOWER GO?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, your speech was one of the nicest things anyone's ever done for me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,When did you come up with the idea? You must've worked on it for days.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,There's sausage being made? Where?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Coming! I haven't forgotten about the sausage.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ooh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah. That's the thing the guys at the drycleaners get so excited about every four years.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Of course I am, but how do you know?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Much better.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, no one has ever has questioned my professionalism. Except at my profession.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What do you think, sweetie?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The two thousand eight Super Bowl?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's okay. I'm an American!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sure, why not?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Congratulations on your purchase of a FootMaster brand soccer ball."" Thanks, book!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I believe the sweet little girl in twenty-one D would disagree with you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look at you, using approved electronic devices.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here you go, honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The stomach wants what it wants. I need some air.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, Brazil. I couldn't stay afraid of you forever. The only thing that keeps me from living here is that fish that swims up your pee stream. That is a deal breaker.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thanks. I still can't believe the yellow and red cards don't stand for mustard and ketchup.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You don't know the new me of the last few days at all!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Red card!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get outta here!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How fresh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where's your mother?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Give the donuts to the hotel staff. Release the pig, and the bowling ball, into the wild.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes. But knowing that Lisa chose me as her hero... without ever considering any other hero... keeps me strong.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why so quiet?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm listening. And it better be devastating.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my God. That's, that's shattering. And now, I'm a man in pain in the naughtiest city since San Francisco turned all nerdy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,To drink until there's no pain left in my soul. But first I'm gonna eat off someone else's room service tray that was left in the hall!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine. Marge is always complaining I never fix things. Give me another.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I carry my own.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If I bet it, I could double it. But on who?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thanks for telling me. I was gonna tape it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wave a Brazilian flag so you'll stand out in the crowd.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're a funny one to tell me about deception.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, if we're going to be brutally honest, that drawing you made of me when you were three was far from a perfect likeness.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It was pity-fridged!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, come here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Everything's right with the world.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's all right, brain. If I die, I'll be doing the thing I love the most: trying not to get killed.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No penalty!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I repeat, no penalty!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No penalty!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, at least I'll die the American way. In a foreign country wearing short pants.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No penalty.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've never seen anything so beautiful.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey-hey, what--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cleats.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Um... maybe some easy-listening music will make you feel better about the story. Turn on eighty-nine point nine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Like most of my problems, it all started at Moe's...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Once intoxicated, we had a great idea.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey! Look at me! I'm going up a slide!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Best recess ever!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Help me guys! Guys?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Am I gonna die on a playground, like some uncoordinated child?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I did learn something from all this. The sprinklers in this park come on at three a.m.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, are the kids with you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, guys! Why are you ducked down like that?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't worry. It's bottom all right.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Competitive eater? Did I hear right? I could be a competitive eater?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes I did! I heard ""competitive eater""!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then that makes me the Jackie Robinson of the sport. And you are the racist Philadelphia manager!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I will when you open your mind to change!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Eight hundred dollars to cut me outta that slide? It's all about the money with those firemen.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,She can smash a salad.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, if you want me to do something, just tell me. Don't hide behind a magazine.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait. Let me get this straight. Sit and eat? That's my punishment?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I can fake attentive. I've been watching a football game this whole discussion.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay. We'll make it fun. I'll take her to that crab place. All the crabs you could smash.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,She might marry someone like me? You think that would be bad!?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you are comparing me to the most infuriating thing in the newspaper!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm sleeping on Flanders' couch tonight. Ours is crap.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...so Marge says I gotta ""ask Lisa on a date.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Feels weird.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, It's ringing!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, Hello. Lisa. I know your brother and...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stupid, stupid, stupid!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, yeah. Hey, listen, your mom thinks that maybe you and I should have dinner together, sometime...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, I knew you'd think it's dumb--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo-hoo! I got a date with my daughter!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, Marjorie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, well it's a special evening. And I thought it best not to look like a monkey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry. I won't embarrass you. I will put my napkin in my lap. I will use the utensils provided for me. And if our food is slow in coming I will ""blow my stack"" in a manner befitting the Earl of Yarborough.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I can't screw this up or Lisa will get stuck with someone like me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, pepperoni!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is there no end to your fault-finding?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Maggie, help me with this shirt.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nope. Now, how's that drink? Can I Temple up that Shirley?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, yeah, help me out here. What is the ""normal amount"" of entrees per person?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I mean for adults!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No. I mean for adult males.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, I'll have the lasagna.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, uh. Vegetarian. Can the red sauce be cow blood?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge please, control your jealousy. This is your daughter!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um. Excuse me, Lisa.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A friend from high school.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm sorry, that's all very nice. But I can't forget what you said.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where'd you get that dress?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow. Wow. That looks just like the dress you wore on Project Runway.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, right. I mean, this looks like a dress from a local Springfield store. All is forgiven. Let's have dinner.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, Frenchy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, how much did I eat?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pfft! I'm as healthy as a horse.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge is right. I'm gonna walk upstairs, take her in my arms and tell her my good health starts now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Legs pumping! Blood flowing!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Two at a time! Heart exploding.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All that's left are clever last words.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm number two!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Somebody kill me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Amen, baby! Did you make potato salad for the wake?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm back! Comin' through!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, I can die all I want -- Frink's got Homers like the Tuileries has park benches. Huh? Wonder where I picked that up.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Two weeks?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yo. Where's my body?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bonk! Bonk! Bonk! Ooh, corner! Ba-donk!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey kids, wanna chase Grandpa Homer around the house?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's not exactly fun and games for me either, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, ""Goody Gobble""!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Woo-hoo, liquid center power-up!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, Marge? 'Scuse me. Uh, I think I need a reboot.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just stick the tip of your pen in that little hole and hold it for fifteen minutes...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no, no! Don't pull me out before you click eject! That hurts like a mother--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, can you put me in 3-D for a second?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little! I'll teach you to emulate my sloppiness!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,'Bout time!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey! Where's my junk?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whew!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sure.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Body. To Moe's.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on! Hug your Grampa, boys!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Threat perceived. Terminate! Terminate!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Kids are so afraid of being terminated.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lookin' good, Santa's Little Hybrid.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think that's about to change.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, even my personality has gotten, shall we say, an upgrade.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whoa. That's a bit of a woo-hoo. Indeed.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sit down.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, better get home. The delightfulness ended hours ago.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why are you doing this to me, booze? I drank every kind of you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Have a good day, you two! Don't be me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Do you know how embarrassed I was to get a call, at my arraignment, for my behavior during the pub crawl, because of a voodoo curse my son placed on his art teacher?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, everyone does, son. That's why they lock it up in museums where no one will ever visit.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I created three kids, and no one's making a big deal of that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah... well just talk about sports!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Flanders! Can we borrow your spatula?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And you never bought a replacement?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little! I'll teach you to answer peoples' prayers!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What is your problem, boy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow. I've gotta take that in. While I do, have some bar nuts.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Eat the nuts! They're your dinner!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, Moe, I... huh. Must've left my wallet at home.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fat Tony?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Do you really need the boy's help to make a baby? Just do a little of the bunga-bunga, and the hotsie-potsie, and the bop-bada-bop-bada-bop.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well boy, if there was ever a good time for you to find out where babies come from, in the grossest way possible, with your life on the line, this is it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Anything else?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How is it my fault?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,LET THEM RUCK THE NIGHT AWAY!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I just did that because it was a series of funny words!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Huh? Maybe you're right, boy. It's time I was a better father. And I'll start by saving us. I just need to facilitate some horse intercourse.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, buddy. Just make a champion thoroughbred and we're outta here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you know, I don't think this guy likes girls.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not like that. It's like this. ...Smithers ... ...Mr. Largo... ...Danny Kaye... What? Everyone knows.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now where's she going?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I know that horse! It's Sudsley! Sudsley Brew-Right!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That horse was instrumental in me becoming a man.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Beer transformed that cute little boy into the man you see before you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, pregnant is pregnant...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We're not lost, boy. Not by a longshot. We just have to set the mood.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"LET THEM PLAY! WE WON'T LOOK, WE'LL TURN AWAY / GO MAKE LOVE, THEN EAT SOME HAY...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,BE THAT AS IT MAY,,,,,
Homer Simpson,FAT TONY'S HORSE IS GAY!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,ROLL IN HAY!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I DON'T CARE ABOUT TOMORROW / WE NEED TRUE HORSE LOVE TODAY,,,,,
Homer Simpson,HERE'S A BLANKET THEY CAN BORROW,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, young love.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You monster! My knees will be in my throat!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Teach him not to pee during parades. He'll get more work.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ooh! Can I lick the ceiling?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, doubles!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Because couples friends are a myth, started by restaurants with tables for four.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, sweetie, I'll call the Van Houtens.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,They all make good points.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh. Thank you. Why was that on the Military History Channel?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can I check out what toys they have?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dinner party at the neighbors'. At least I can drink.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Walking distance, Marge. I've been looking forward to this all week!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, I have more cheeks.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They'll get their blood money.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Question. It says here the murderer is Admiral Wainsworth. Who's that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, you know--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, as we say in Russia: ""Goodbye in Russian""!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, nice night for a walk.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do you want to be more alone?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,More?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, I slept on the couch, and I flipped the sweaty cushions over. What else can I do?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmmm--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Because... Oh. Oh, okay, okay. What should we do?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I see.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo-hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, if that's how you think it has to be.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It might be easier with Maggie. She's always getting letters from the Daycare center.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So... where are all the friends?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who are you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, Lisa's going to be here in five minutes, and the only kid who showed up is Gus Frickin' Huebner!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah. Nothin-- Nothing's going on.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lots of pizza.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"See, Marge. Problems will work themselves out if you just leave them alone.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You gave away ice cream?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh God, oh God, I'm the smart parent.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm sorry she rejected your ""I'm Sorry,"" cake, but in a way, I'm not. I guess what I'm trying to say is I like cake.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is that the boy you named me after?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You pay Lenny and Carl to be my friends?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dad, is that story really true?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Crap!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, Marge. As a favor to you, I'm enrolling that precious little jerk in this fresh air summer camp.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Needs more numerators.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, July fourth-- No fireworks?! Can't this stupid city entertain me one night a year?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, when you're broke, that's when you've got to keep up appearances. The Fourth of July is the one day a year when our city puts on her high heels and tube top, and leans into America's car window. God bless her.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, if this stupid, one-reactor town won't put on a fireworks show, I will. I've mapped it out.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've had my problems with sparklers.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now let's see... which pants have that card? board shorts, interested shorts, here we are.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Kaboom.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Giuseppe, I want you to come out of retirement for the greatest fireworks show of your career.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If the Expendables movies have taught us anything, it's that people do their best work after they're old and forgotten.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay. Let's make some fireworks.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh thank God. A rickety bridge.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can I pitch something?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My boy's having a bad night. We should get the show on the road.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Come on. Let's go. I can't stand to see my family unhappy on America's holiest day.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Super Mario. Don't you tell me about America!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, you're a-wrong!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who the hell is that?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,SOMETIMES WHEN WE TOUCH,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"One more year, tops.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Then burn on you, 'cause you'll be holding onto a dead guy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Believe me, if you're holding a three-hundred-pound dead guy, fear is not gonna be your problem.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's a song? I thought we were just riffing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Usher! Will you stop that person who's shushing?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Out of my reach? Must... make... effort...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's on TV?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little! I'll show you who's a Flabbi!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All muscle. In Minnesota I'd be a supermodel!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, son. We can.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh? Oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, yeah, great. I guess my getting-up days are over.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, what are you doing?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Lisa, honey, you can't insulate yourself from life. Why I could live till a hundred or a bus could hit me tomorrow. That's why I never plan more than four seconds ahead.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now come on, give Daddy a hug.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bubble wrap!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Your daughterly love saved me, sweetie!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Me neither.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Brief nudityyy!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I thought we installed parental blocking software on all our computers.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I told you to clean your room and instead you're watching chest videos! Look at all those bowls of half-eaten cereal!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I know how cereal works. Now clean your room.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm in charge. You do what I say.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That better not mean what it means when I say it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We're not similar. I love being told what to do by someone who's wise in the ways of the world! Love it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You poor woman. Dealing with Bart has turned your mind to ketchup water. You rest. I'll be the boy's father now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Milk. That's for babies and old guys who can't sleep at night because of what they did in the war. Broccoli.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You are not leaving this table until you eat that broccoli. And I'm going to sit right here until you do.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Eat your broccoli.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Eat your broccoli.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Today's our draft! I've got to pick a good fantasy team! When I lost last year they made me do something so humiliating...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Jebus loves Tebow.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I want you, my wife, to draft my fantasy football team.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can get another job! Who wouldn't want to hire a man who won't back down? I could be a prison warden or a southern anything.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, works for me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You did that on purpose! You lick this table clean!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Come on. Lick it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, lick it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You can still lick it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know. Eat your broccoli.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We're on an old-time boat!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Relation Ship. It works two ways. Pretty good. Pret-ty good.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm the lame ass? The only lame ass on this boat is you and all the other lame asses.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute... windswept hair, rugged tan, rough, calloused hands. You're enjoying this, aren't you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're my son and you will hate what I hate. Angled parking. Lemons. Kickstarters by famous guys who already have lots of money. And this boat!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Betrayed by my worst enemy. I never would have seen it coming.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I finally got over my sea sickness.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I hate the Golden Age of Sail.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fine. I'll swab whatever you say. Look, I'm swabbing the deck. I'm swabbing this giant tree that the sail grows out of. Oh! I'm swabbing the top of the ocean.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooo! Swab, swab, swab--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fantasy football has turned every man in this town into a trash-talking monster!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I love this boat, with all its pullies and flappies and... everything has a name.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you crazy? We'll never make it! Drop the anchor and wait out the storm!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm dropping the anchor!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You've never done what I say! Ever!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Awaiting your orders, Mr. Midshipman!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aye-aye, sir.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Does this answer your question?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I GOT A BAD SUNBURN AND I WAS CRAPPED ON BY A SEAGULL / I DON'T SEE ANY LIFEBOATS AND I DON'T THINK THAT IS LEGAL,,,,,
Homer Simpson,WAY HEAL AWAY! / WE'LL HEAL AWAY JOE!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey! I was listenin' to that!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Absolutely not.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"My one weakness: the third ""really."" Come with me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Turn right here. I keep this frozen meat in case society collapses but we still have power.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Seriously, I am getting so tired of those stupid Flandersisms.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okily Dokahama?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's all gonna thaw!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't you give up on me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I will wait and worry!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, somebody wants more crusts. Here you go, boy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Here ya go. Have some more.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Still hungry, buddy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lucky.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Marge, once again you've taken one of my screw-ups and turned it into food. Man, if only you could do that with Bart.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Familyicious.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What are you doing here, freezer stealer?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Flanders isn't perfect!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah! And aren't!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,None.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Careful, Marge, that's how I bankrupted a Pizza Hut.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, you woke up the right man in bed.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I love you, Marjorie. And I've had my share of failures, sure. And sometimes I get pretty nervous. But thanks for talking it out with me. I think I can finally get to sleep now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Make love now?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no, I'd like to see the manager.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, come on, let's celebrate! It's your first day!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Tony Roma's wasn't built in a day. But don't worry. I told everyone about this place and they're all going to support you. You do have drone delivery, right? I kinda promised that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dammit!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, baby.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, Marge. They can't beat us. Because we're family-run.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hillbillies!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Finally! A customer!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, Mr. Burns, I'd like you to meet... Mother Hubbard standee.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whew!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, have you ever seen pants do this?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm a litigious business man and I need a coffee to go.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why do these things happen to innocent victims? I was just about to become a million dollar crotch model!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Please tell me I'm still beautiful!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, family, we should be proud. We took on corporate America and broke even.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmm. Sandwich.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Keep your pants on, Marge. It's probably some private school that costs a million dollars a year -- and then they squeeze you for extra money through ""book fairs"" and ""silent auctions."" And parents get twenty emails a day from the school, and everyone hits ""reply all"" to everything!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that's fine then.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll say it, Marge, it's in Hell! The Inferno! Perdition! Arizona without the golf!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nooo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hm. That is the kind of nonsense you're always falling for.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, I'll be sure to take a look at that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, boy. I want you to do it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, you went to Hell and came back a winner, like Jesus. Now come on, boy! Pull me apart like string cheese.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Which one's yours?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nice.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid blood. Asking me for a favor.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh Marge, that was fast. Yeah, that's it, baby. Grab my chest with your cold icy hands.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The bed is lifting me! The elevator at work can't even do that! I demand you put me down right after the sex!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, show yourselves in the name of this book!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The power of Chrysler compels you!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey... if you're Homer Simpson, show me your driver's license.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,He is me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why is it always me? I work twelve hours a week, you know!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So... yeah. Things aren't perfect with the missus and me. And by the way, nice melons.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't believe you wasted our money on fruit.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can you be more specific?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There's no reason to be jealous, it's just younger you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, hello.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A ghost!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't yell at me! I'm a double widower! But I can handle all the ghosts you can float at me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I think he gets it. See, he--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow! Ooh! What the? Mmm! I smell toast!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ooh... pork chops with gravy!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey... but today's not Pork Chop Tuesday... or Gravy Thursday.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I love Canadian on Canadian violence. Oh baby, this is so great! Thank you so much!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute -- that's not something people really feel. What's going on?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, Marge... no! You can't invite a couple of Riddlers to stay in the Bat Cave!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hm, oh honey, one teensy problem with this plan. I'm a teensy bit concerned about them smoking around the children. You know, their lungs are so teensy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And if you trust them, I trust them too.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Safety first.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bad news, bears. Forecast calls for nothing but rain.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If you fall asleep with them, will you even burn to death?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ha! I gotcha!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You can't resist smoking in the house any more than I can resist drinking in the car.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And now I banish you from paradise! I'm glad I never bothered to learn which one of you is which.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I know just the place.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lisa! Motorcade!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo-hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Woo-hoo? I don't know... ""Fracking"" is one of those scary Lisa words.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, Charlie. Maybe fracking isn't so bad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm not screwing you over. No, uh... I'm not screwing you over. I'm not screwing you over.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Some folks will tell you that fracking's no good. But what they don't tell you is... hydraulic fracturing creates jobs.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And all those new workers are gonna want to spend their earnings buying what you're selling: beer.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Authentic Italian food.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Useless left-handed crap.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Magical nonsense.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Expensive toys for grownups they don't open or play with.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pornography and nachos.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,High-quality Spanish language programming.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,High-quality methamphetamines.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Laundry. Homework. Pranks. Poop, poop and poop.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Because I've never gotten a promotion before. Once I thought I had, but it turned out to be a beautifully-worded firing. So judge me all you want.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good, judge away.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Everyone who signs over their mineral rights to Mr. Burns gets five thousand dollars!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Burns, we did it! Everyone in the neighborhood sold us their gas rights.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Excellent?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well... one.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh baby...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm no Carl when it comes to this stuff. But I ain't no Lenny neither. And I would say... no matter how much you try to keep things casual, someone always gets hurt.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Glad I could be of help...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge? Why didn't you sign?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge Simpson... I'm as mad at you as you usually are at me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah, great. Great, Marge. Great work. Thanks to you, Springfield will never be a natural gas boom town. And like all boom towns it would have lasted forever.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Was on fire. Was. I finally get a job I was good at, and now I have to give it up.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait, Mr. Burns! I'm here to man up -- it was all my wife's fault! Sometimes I think she and I have nothing in common.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge likes sushi, I like gum that squirts in your mouth. She's into romantic comedies, I like movies where there's only one day a year when murder is legal. Yep, Marge and I see the world in totally different ways.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So you don't miss that politics lady at all?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Killdozers.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gravy Thursday.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You don't know anything about hydraulic fracturing! You've just been brainwashed by liberal TV shows who use ""fracking"" as an easy bad guy. But it can save this country!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait... I finally get what you're saying. Fracking is great. But the only place it should ever happen is in other people's towns!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, a couch is a couch.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the hell was that?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Relax, Marge. It's probably just Homer comin' home late from Moe's.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The eyes in that picture are following me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Isn't all great art kind of a mirror?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We'd better send the dog down. Come on. Here's your chance to protect us, boy. Come on.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid dog!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We'll have to set a trap, bait. I mean, Bart.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All set. When he starts gnawing at you, I'll whack him with this broom.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't drink my loved ones!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A robot with a catchphrase!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, so what are you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Prove it. What happens to Homer Simpson in the future?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh. My. God. He's telling the truth. I have to take you to our civic leaders.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen, I-I know you're a robot and incapable of emotion...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, look, I just wanna ask... can we be friends?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're the only guy I know with less hair than me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah! Hey, uh, what's the robot version of bromance?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You future guys have a word for everything... pal.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My ears are burning.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A boxing glove!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But we bowled together.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You don't have to announce it. Just do it quietly and blame the dog.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll explain. Okay, it starts free, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Then you visit your friend's game, and he's got this awesome candy mansion...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...and you're like ""ninety-nine cents? You bet I'd like one...""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And that's why I owe Clash of Candies twenty thousand dollars. Here we are.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'd like you to meet Leela and Fry.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Start with Flanders... start with Flanders...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who is that?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We're here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My bowling buddy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little... why you little... why you little... why you little... why you little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Prove it. When's your birthday?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ha! February has no twenty-third!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I was voted Employee of the Month as an April Fool's Day joke. Why you little... why you little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I haven't had a drink in a thousand years.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aww, I will treasure this forever.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good night, friend. You'll always have a special place here with us.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"SIMPSONS, IN THE / FUTURE -- SPACE JOKES! / FLYING THROUGH TOWN / WHAT ARE THOSE TUBES / I WONDER WHAT / ICE CREAM'S LIKE NOW / MAYBE IT'S HOT / OR SOME NEW TEMPERATURE THEY INVENTED... That's it, we're done.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You wanna talk about it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, thank you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A haircut? Let me see!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I won't laugh at you. Let's see--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look at me! I'm Bart!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, please don't say anything. It never makes a difference and then the teachers give us stink-eye during the school fairs.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What camping trip?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, uh... you told me not to do it a year ago. Remember?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're right. No one could be expected to remember something from a year ago. Certainly not me. Pass the gravy?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, there's always room at Buzzard's Roost.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Excuse me, but grass is poking through.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Poking through.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Poking through.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge, I can't stand it when you cry at dinner. The pork chops look traumatized. The mashed potatoes can't stand watch. Even the children seem upset. So trust me, I will come through for you, baby.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, what do you say, Marge?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I want you to believe me too. Isn't it great how much we agree?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Compared to the rest of these people, yeah.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, I really need a campsite. My wife is making sandwiches!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What about Mosquito Cove?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Skunk Canyon?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ooh! How 'bout the campsite where the guy in the hockey mask kills all the campers?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello? Hello? This is Homer Simpson! 742 Evergreen Terrace, looking for a place for my kids and me! And my pretty, pretty wife!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, alarm code three six seven nine. Three six seven nine!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I have a confession to make about this trip.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Once again, I've been saved from any consequences. It'll keep happening till one day I create a mess so enormous it can't be cleaned up. Thanks, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A CAMPING WE WILL GO...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A PLACE THAT'S FILLED WITH SUN AND SAND / A DESERT STEAMPUNK DISNEYLAND / KEEP EXPECTATIONS LOWWW... / SWING LOW SWEET CHARIOT...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Homer Simpson, I love you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cars shaped like cupcakes!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All camping is pointless. You drive hundreds of miles to shower and sleep in a place with no bathroom or beds. I guess what I'm trying to say is: where's Maggie?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, listen here, Desert Arnaz. Homer Simpson knows how to pitch a tent.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey man, can I bum a tent?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey Marge!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We got a new tent from a guy who O.D.'d!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, let me get a picture of that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This place is great. Just have to avoid these inseam-high cactuses!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get... in... the tent!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just like I planned.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I understand. I already signed up for this place next year. I Gave my form and two hundred dollars cash to that dude.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll take those.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Beware the butterfly's sting! What the?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,...and that's the terrifying tale of how the Quebec Nordiques became the Colorado Avalanche.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, how many times have I told you to bow down to our corporate overlords?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's like some kind of guitar central.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stig. You've got a name that's not a name.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I don't have what it takes to play guitar. I mean, I'm no Joe Walsh in the brains department.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the rock?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I did a lick?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my god... I'm amazing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm not set at all.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This is embarrassing to admit, Stig, but I hadn't even thought about gels.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,MUSIC! BEAUTIFUL MUSIC!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Beautiful music, baby.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sure it is. You know I've always loved laying things down. Grooves are just the latest.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I feel a powerful connection to the history of famous bass players. Like what's his name from The Who. Or that guy from Led Zeppelin who wasn't Page, Plant or Bonham. Those are the only two I know for sure.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah, and you know what's the great thing is about music? It's so easy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So easy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know guys. I'm not sure I'm feeling this. The bass is kind of known for being a solo instrument.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I almost forgot the most important thing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Great practice, guys. What do you say we give it another six hours then call it a day?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh... yeah, Apu, I'm sure you're a great singer. But the balance of the band is really delicate right now, and we're not really looking for a ""world music"" vibe. No disrespect to world music. I love world music.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That sounds nothing like terrible, terrible world music.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Guys, are you feeling this? Are you feeling this?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We are more than just a garage band desperate to do anything other than hang out with our families. We are now a cover band. And we shall be called... Covercraft. Because we play covers and this is our craft.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That was not my intent. Okay, Covercraft: hands in.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cover...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"R ""O"" ""K"" ""C"".",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, this crowd is about to experience the special magic of the cover band -- the thrill of live music without the fear of hearing anything new.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Apu, what's wrong?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I still want one.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Buddy, buddy. Think of it this way: you're not singing in front of all those people, you're alone at the Kwik-E-Mart in the middle of the night. You just wear this on stage, and everything will be fine.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well son, I do have the talent -- my mind is full of ideas for great songs I could write... down the names of and then cover. But then I remember: I'm just a regular guy, jamming with my buds.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yep. It's all about the music... and it would take a pretty unforeseen development to change that. Pretty unforeseen...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Guys, I really need your honesty here. At the Squidport Senior Jamboree... was I too in the pocket?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What kind of erotic asphyxiation?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I think I can answer for Apu. He's flattered, but the small-time success of Covercraft is all that any of us have ever wanted.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Apu has a rich life here in Springfield: a store full of great products, a lovely him-type wife, and eight super kids: Anoop, Sandeep, Nabendu, Gheet, Pria, Uma, Poonam, Sashi--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not me. I'm nothing but happy that our friend is headed for fame and fortune.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I want his fame and fortune so much! Why must the Lords of Rock be so cruel?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sammy Hagar? You're not dead.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's something you make sketches about.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm not jealous. I'm envious. Jealousy is when you worry someone will take what you have. Envy is wanting what someone else has. What I feel is envy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You know what? Apu leaving is the best thing that ever happened to this band. We're gonna be like Genesis after Peter Gabriel left.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Phil Collins-era Genesis is not as good, huh? ""No Reply at All,"" ""Land of Confusion,"" ""Throwing it All Away,"" ""Illegal Alien,"" ""I Can't Dance,"" and I'm sure I don't need to mention... ""Invisible Touch!""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What? So you can also get famous and bail on us? You're out of the band!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, so you're sticking up for Yoko here? Looks like I've got another Yoko on my hands.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yoko! Yoko! Yoko! Yoko! Yoko! All you Yokos are out of the band!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do I sound okay?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,They're not juicy. My licks are dry. Dry and scratchy like a cat's tongue.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well it's not enough anymore. When something great happens to one person, everyone else's life gets a little worse. Look it up, it's called physics.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you mean he generously invited us to come watch him be a rock star?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll never have a per diem.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Apu wouldn't be able to sing a note if I didn't help him get over his stage fright with his Kwik-E-Mart shirt...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Backstage pass, you just became a payback rage pass.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look at all this rock star dressing room stuff. What a sellout. Cheese plate -- oh, sorry, cubed cheese plate, lemon tea, probably for his throat...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let's see how he performs in front of all those people without his magic-people-performing-in-front-of shirt.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm sorry, Apu. I thought you were living your dream life, so naturally I wanted to ruin it. But now I know things stink, so I'm okay with it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kwik-E-Mart hot dog, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,HOPIN'! HOPIN'!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll be right home, honey. I've just got to lock down the reactor for the evening.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Tight as a drum.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mr. Scrooge!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Headin' home, baby.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nothing's gonna stop me now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maybe a drink will help me with my driving.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'd better be heading home... to my family... enjoy your evening... with your wonderful... uh... neon sign...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, um, you gonna be okay?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay! Okay! I'll stay for one beer.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I promised Marge.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what the--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I am so late!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, think about what you're saying. It's Sir Isaac Newton's birthday!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah?! Well, good luck assembling all those toys without me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The ghost of Marge Future!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe, what are you doing?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, pal. Can't believe you have to work Christmas Eve.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maybe Marge would forgive me if I won the lotto. Give me a scratcher.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gimme another one.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gimme another one.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gimme another one.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gimme another one.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gimme another one.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gimme another one.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but doesn't the money go to schools?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, thanks for your honesty, Apu. Is there any other product in the store you'd like to warn me about?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't wanna ruin the magic and I certainly,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Next year... this is... your job.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,... ...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,... Ooh!... ...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Even the anchor store's closed.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Any uplifting holiday movies?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I guess I'll take the Concentration Camp one.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, if I've gotta spend Christmas Eve alone, at least no one will see me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What if I left now, and gave you guys my popcorn and soda?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Flanders? What are you doing here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Say Flanders, with all the hard luck you've had, how do you stay so happy? And don't say ""Jesus.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Flanders, are you crying?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen. Could I buy a left-handed uh... I don't know, eyelash curler?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Um. Maybe.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Because Jerk-ass Homer has become Ass-jerk Homer.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're all right, Stupid Flanders. You're all right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I made everyone happy but me. Some Christmas. Feliz Navidad.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The Nutcracker! Every child's favorite Christmas character! Is this a dream?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man, you are a nutcracker. But I've learned something tonight: you know how everyone hates being with their family on Christmas? Well, being without them is worse. Can you find it in your wooden heart to give me a break?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What are you doing here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my God. Is that girl really doing that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mmm, load-bearing wall.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This party's great. But all I wish is that I was drinking a beer with my kids right now.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hm?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Marge, you found me! You always find me. Now we just have to find your car in the mall parking lot.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, well, I've been faking the noise 'cause you deserve the best.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thank you magical creatures of the mall.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You have all taught me a Christmas message I'll never forget: the place to get drunk is at home.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the? This isn't Halloween!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay! We're there! Finally!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Damn technology!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Turn it off!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, spot!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, this time I'm gonna write down where I parked.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look! I see land!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You planted that on me, man!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fine. But I'm not paying for the insurance. Oh, what the hell, give me the insurance.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"well, that's it. We've visited every section including Churro County, Toonton Abbey...but you know what we haven't had here? I'll tell you: fun. The kind of fun attractive families have in commercials.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I just wanna sit down, but the line for the bench is too long.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, those maps were drawn by the first explorers of this theme park, hundreds of years ago. Let's go.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Come on! Start this thing! I'm not impressed.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is so fake.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Prove it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the? This isn't Halloween.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's good.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Captain Squid! If you really want to be nice to us, how 'bout some snacks?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Potato chips!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid kid! You ruin every trip!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let me just... there you are... like new... not a freak of nature...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look at all these knobs and buttons. They are clearly a superior race. But maybe that means they'll be nice to us.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's right. Pick the only two times in history where things got messy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow. This place is completely alien but everything's in English. Just like Canada.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can I turn my phone on?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I say we take this bucket home!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,To Earth!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Come on... come on... you son of a--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, you really went with the purple theme.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait, are you telling me we're prisoners in this cage?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"See, Marge?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're the doctor.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This isn't a happy thing!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, we haven't heard from Maggie yet.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the? Pfft. Gibberish! Pure gibberish!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"'Tis a far, far better thing I do than I have ever done before.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That kid's got talent, but c'mon!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I get it, Lisa. I finally get it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'd like rabbit. Lots of rabbit.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fondue? Welcome to a faculty dinner party in nineteen seventy-nine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes! This mysterious tube can only lead somewhere good. So long you stupid slobbering... what the?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And away we go!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, what do you eat, space broccoli?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where are you taking me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why are they dancing? Shouldn't they be making weapons?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...but perhaps Earth's greatest achievement is moon rocks. Oh, and the golden age of radio.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What about my family?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sex mate? Clearly you've never been married. But it's great, I'm telling you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, it is a great party.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Suddenly, this trip has gotten interesting.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh who am I kidding? I couldn't enjoy calorie one without my family. I'm going back to save them.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You forgot to glaze me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think somebody's afraid to admit he's out of glaze.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Glaze, please.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It does look delicious.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't you people realize your queen is dying?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Captain's log, Star date: six-five-eight-four-eight point two. After successfully conquering the Rigelians...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I have such a big ass.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Set a course, Mr. Maggie. Anywhere but home.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,WALKIN' DOWN A CORRIDOR / USIN' BOTH MY FEET / WISH I WAS IN FLORIDOR / NOW I WILL REPEAT / OH I'M WALKIN' DOWN A CORRIDOR / USIN' BOTH MY FEET...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We sure will miss your, your, um, uh -- what'd you do again?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But, wait a minute! That's my job!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That would explain a lot. But why did you do it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, please! All I'm asking you to do is stay twenty-one more years!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stressful. Do you see how loose my tie is?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,For the first time I actually had to do my job.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And Marge, I've got this weird new feeling in my stomach. A little sour and a little sick.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They have a lot of funny words for not-so-funny things.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, I don't have time for childish games. If I don't do my job, atoms go boom!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Can I get a four fifty-five wakeup call?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's called a double standard. One of the bedrocks of parenting.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No. Marge, if I lose my job in this economy, it's a death sentence. Oh, I guess, as a fallback, I could direct films like Angelina Jolie. How many properties do we have an option on?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?! When were you gonna tell me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,When?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The circus? Hmmm, I haven't been to the circus since I was a kid.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, Marge. We can go to the circus. Maybe I can finally find out why a man would think a stool is a proper defense against a lion.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dammit! This circus Wi-Fi is a joke!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How can anyone relax when they made us park in stack parking?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What kind of insane parking system is designed so you're blocked in by everyone that arrived after you?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The early bird gets the shaft!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my God. What if all those clowns are parked in the same lot as us? Maybe there's better Wi-Fi in the freak tent.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"'Scuse me, pardon me, what the Hell?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh! Finally! The business call I've been waiting for! Hello, this is--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, kids! There's nothing you'd be interested in here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eh, they'll grow back.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh for God's-- now? Do you have to?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine. But I'll be amazed if I'm astounded.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, is that time right? I have a deadline in an hour and a half!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, patter!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, but we're having fun trying. Wait, I mean three.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, can we get to the point? I'm stack parked. Did you hear me? Stack...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No I'm not.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No I'm not.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No I'm not.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes you are.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes you are.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah you are too.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know you are but what am I, infinity plus one! Jinx!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ew! Gross!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Help... help me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Psych!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oops.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ask for boogers on Bart's half!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Get the ball, boy! C'mon!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Go get it, boy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Go get it, boy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Go get it, boy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey! Ow! Ow! I thought you were my best friend! Ow! Ow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um, Mrs. Simpson?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'd be too nervous. Have you noticed that she's kinda hot?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm ready to go to school.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm not? Cool! Am I sick?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"'Cause if I'm sick, I get to stay home and make s'mores. All I need is graham crackers, chocolate, marshmallows, sticks, fire...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...did I say graham crackers?... chocolate, marshmallows, sticks, fire...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can I play?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm beat.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Today was fun.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll eat in bed. Not just snacks, messy stuff like lasagna... Oh, and TV would be on. Loud.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Pff. Wife? Three kids? Steady job? If I did, I'd secretly be very sad. You could tell by how much I would eat and drink and just sit on the couch.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah. Thank God that never happened.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lisa...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,...your Ma says I should do something with you. Need some help with your homework?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wanna see me make a muscle?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, that's everything I know that girls like.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO-DOO-DOO D-DOO-DOO / DOO DOO DOO D-DOO-DOO DOO-DOO-DOO D-DOO D-DOO-DOO D-DOO DOO D-DOO DOO,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"D-DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO! Y'know, you're the closest thing I've ever had to a brother.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Change back to what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bloated corpse under the water. I'd say he's been there a few months at least. Interesting the way his lips move just like mine. Why do you ask?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What do we do next? What do we do next?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bye, Bart. Stay ten forever.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,- parked! I hate stack parking! Wait! Where am I? This isn't the circus! It's an amusement park! The furthest thing from a circus!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, sweetie, I'm not gonna lie. I must have tied one on at Moe's. If you have it in your heart, could you forgive me and totally blame my friends?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ooh! I've missed you too.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the? Lasagna in bed?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Y'know, I used to have this friend... I told him all my dreams. Really, really great kid.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The best. Wonder what ever happened to him.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, boy, I'm not sure I can strangle you anymore. I'm gonna try something new.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What do you say, boy? Wanna split the lasagna?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's good to be back.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can we cuddle for a little while?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It is!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, an eagle is our country's mascot. Fighting him is like kicking George Washington in his wooden nuts!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This means war! Boy, bring my toupee!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Go ahead, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, Pittsburgh thirty-five, Dallas thirty-one!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ha-ha! Stupid eagle! It wasn't the mouse we were after, it was you! Marge! Preheat the oven!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You-- get-- out!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I've got him cornered, boy! Bag him up!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not so majestic in a trash bag, are ya?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oopsie.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Seems almost a shame I'm gonna have to bang you against a wall till you die.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Um...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay. Bart, think of a name. Make it great. Insanely, unbelievably great!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Perfect! Just like when we let you name Maggie.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bye!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my God! Brace yourselves, family. We're about to meet a being with intelligence far beyond ours. Boy, get me my baseball bat.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Die!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're the guy who put wheels on luggage? Oh, bless you! Bless you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And now he's landed in our yard, on my son's bike and on our mailman's leg.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mmm, raisin detra.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Elon, if you're interested, you could come to the nuclear plant where I work tomorrow.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Great. And if anyone asks where I am, just cover for me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Fine. We'll both go. And if anybody asks you something you don't understand, just say, ""protons.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So do you get satellite radio cheaper in space?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Ass, gas or grass, no one rides for free."" It's as old as the Bible.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ditto.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, man, I wish those were white meatballs.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh... don't tase me, bro. Chocolate rain!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What about the chocolate?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Um...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I gotcha!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well duh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Suggestion for the ""suggestion box.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Be my guest, but I seriously doubt the old man ever reads 'em.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Careful, Elon. He's not as kindly as he appears.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So... what kind of lunch do you pack?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow. Elon, you're like Willie Wonka without the underpaid munchkins.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, I'd like to offer you something... but all I've got is coffee... with cream!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, I want cream! Give it up! cream and sugar are one thing too many!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow. Wow. Between your genius and my nothing, we make a great team. Come on, give me a hug.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm not one for just talking.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Does that drone do date nights with the wife?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,SINCE YOU CAME DOWN FROM THE SKY,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Car, go park at work so people think I'm there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You really came back from that Tommy John surgery.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,More of what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No. It's Elon. I don't care how much he likes me, I don't wanna be friends with him anymore. None of his pie in the sky ideas ever work out. Sky pies are lie pies! Of all the planets in the universe, why did he have to come to this one?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How do you break up with a guy?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, you're good at that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my God! Oh my God! You saved my life. Which is gonna make what I'm about to say even more awkward...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Elon, Elon, Elon! I want to say something to you and I don't want you to be inspired by it. I want you to listen.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't want to be with you anymore.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I could say it's the being shot at or the flat, emotionless way you talk or the fact that PayPal was my idea and I was just about to do it when you came out with it... but really it's that this town isn't ready for you, and neither am I.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's on your face too!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I've saved you one last prize from the Cracker Jack box that is my brain. Use it as you will.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,On a Miami Dolphins helmet the little dolphin is also wearing a helmet.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,When you're sixteen I'll drive you to Cincinnati. And you'll see what there is to see.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nothing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The little dolphin is also wearing a helmet... Wearing a helmet... Wearing a helmet..,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I met a guy. A wonderful guy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Boy. Sure is nice not to be the one on the horse for a change.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Simpler time.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What are you doing?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Artists.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I saved us seats!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thank you, roll of masking tape!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gonna be a tight fit.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, not Maggie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay. Standing O or die!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stop laughing at me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stop fearing me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dammit!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Please keep spinning it. I don't wanna look at it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can't you say something to make me feel better?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's not about health, Marge. It's about going crazy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmmm.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm sorry, I thought you were Over-feeders Anonymous.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So... you guys are proud of what you are?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do you guys serve snacks?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I have so many questions for you. First of all, is this floor reinforced?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, maybe I shouldn't be here. I promised my wife I'd lose weight.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, labels.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who are you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, like Fat Albert.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I am big.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I have a beauty of a sort to some.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ditto. You know I've always wanted to blindly follow somebody, and I think you just might be the guy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, kids! Tonight was a turning point in my life.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, Marge! You have to listen! That place you sent me to changed my life!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"They taught me that I don't need to lose weight, I should just be proud of what I am.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's not what you think. His name is Albert and he taught me not to buy into the lies taught by ""big nutrition.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you're my wife of ten years and I love you. But I must observe the teachings of this man I just met tonight. Now, the first thing I have to do is make amends... with the bathroom scale.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm so sorry I threw you across the room and called you a liar. When you told me I was two hundred and sixty pounds, you were just encouraging me. It was a poem you were writing about my potential. I'm gonna start celebrating my size and I need you with me as a partner. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to talk to the broken porch swing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"From now on, you guys can no longer say these hateful words.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,Right here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Excuse me, pardon me, coming through.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Comin' back, 'scuse me, pardon me...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,There we go. Comin' up... what can I do for you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Guys, I'm comin' back in. Suck in your guts.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I was distinctly promised no math!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, it's not your fault that you can't win against a superior being like Albert.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, I don't want you to ever stop caring about me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I believe you're forgetting America's greatest wartime wheelchair-bound leader: Professor X of the X-Men.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I've never written an eulogy before, but this time I did. Unfortunately, I left it at home.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, lady.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What Albert taught us is that all people have pride and no group should ever be insulted. He knew what was important was how you lived your life every day...till he was taken from us too soon at the age of...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Twenty-three?! People, for God's sake, join a gym.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm sorry I was proud of myself.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It will never happen again. Now come on, let's walk home.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can I ask you something? What is it that keeps you with me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And because you love me, I will not stop yo-yo dieting till I get it right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,At last.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge! Stop that crazy thing!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm not spending my precious Saturday chauffeuring those over-privileged kids to a better life than I ever had.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe, quick! Beer me before I answer the phone!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I need it now!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Marge. I'm supposed to help drive the kids? Oh, man, I wish I knew that sooner, but I just had a beer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Off the hook!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, while you're at it can you pick me up some beer?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey Moe... I'll take care of the bar. You did me a favor today.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man, Moe's barely got two nickels to rub together.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,There's no guys! We haven't made any money.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We don't look at you that way.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Good ol' Dae Ho. Used to give me the pickles off his sandwich. And all I had to do was let him copy some keys.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's where all the problems are!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look Moe, the least you could let me do is anything I want.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, that's the logic. Where's the affection?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Plant-watering guy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What do I do now?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, all right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, you know people can kinda act like they're in grade school.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, Moe, you're a real jerk. I didn't mind so much when it came with beer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, which can makes me look cooler? The Drizzler or Mr. Drip?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, your leaves are drooping. Here, let me turn that gloom into bloom.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Feminine?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So good to be back.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,'Cause boys are already on track to get all the good jobs. The Dirty Dozen? All guys. Twelve Angry Men? Men! The X-Men? Mostly men.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not my department.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, uh, I will turn this corn chip into a wonderful meal, using my greatest skill -- lunchroom trading. Shut your eyes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, sweetie, open those baby blacks!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Babysitting, eh? What do I know about kids?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Princess, why did you put on that coat? You're obviously cold. May I escort you to the radiator?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, just a second. Hey, Marge. Yeah, I'm workin' late. Yep, special project.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Marge. But I am the royal babysitter. If I start watching commoners, the tongues of the court will be awag!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I see. You want excitement. Princess, have you ever heard of Studio Fifty-Four, C-B-G-Bs, the Roxbury?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,All gone. But in their place we have five hundred channels of television. All awesome. Sit down and I'll show you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"He's called ""The Bachelor.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, Princess. I'll take you to a place that's fun with a capital F.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can I try it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm mad I'm not doing it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And you gave it to him?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Eight million?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get outta here!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,She's gone!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Chief! Thank God! I was drinking at Moe's, and I lost an African princess!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes! The prayer I forgot to say has been answered.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Guys, thanks for bailing me out. But I still have a huge problem.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Um, yeah, sure. Hello, this is the princess. I'm with Homer Simpson and I do declare he's wonderful. Oh, that's right, I'm from South Africa. Fiddle dee dee.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Moe Szyslak!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is the part of the fairytale where the princess goes back to the hotel and watches TV!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, may I speak to you, Majesty, father to father?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,There was beer involved. I have two daughters. And I've learned you have to let them go their own way. Even the one-year-old.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And the older one, I can't tell her what to do. And she's only twelve.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,See what I mean? Always an argument.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But the thing you have to remember is that you have to let them be who they are because you love them...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...uh, because you want them to grow...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,...and because you can't strangle a girl.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, God gets your prayers, but he just clicks delete without reading them, like email updates from LinkedIn.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Go, go make magic. You just go.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Revue...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh boy oh boy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,One AM lovin' and two AM steak? Night marriage rules! I guess nothing gets the heart pumping like a church revue.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What are the skits about?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How do you transition between scenes -- hard blackouts or spotlight fades?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nice. You know, it wouldn't be a revue without songs. Tell me about one.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You got yourself one hell of a show, Marge. One hell of a show.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge? Some casino guys have me, and they want the money you took from them, or else.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just tell me one thing, Marge. Why did you lose faith in the revue? I mean, ""Cats and Dogs"" writes itself. CATS AND DOGS ON CAPITAL HILL / THEY DON'T GET ALONG AND NEVER WILL",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"CATS AND DOGS, SQUABBLE'S NEVER ENDING / EVEN WITH SO MUCH LEGISLATION PENDING!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I was taking a moment to enjoy my after dinner night cap...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,If anything happens to Marge... we'll all be orphans!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm comin' for ya baby!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Have you seen this woman? Have you? Have you seen my wife?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do you know where she is?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, as long as it's just questions.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you gonna put my head in a vise?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stole? How is counting cards stealing?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is it even cheating?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't get it. Football players can do the quarterback sneak, and baseball players can steal bases. Why can't I just remember which cards have been played?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I knew you had a vise! I knew it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No deal!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No! An injustice has gone on here for too long.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm not leaving this casino until you stop punishing people for counting cards. They're just playing the game by the rules!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,On a beautiful night like tonight... how could I not?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,There's no time to be careful.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,We're late.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Norman. How's it going? So you got dragged down here, too... heh, heh. How ya doing, Fred? Excuse me, Fred.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pardon my galoshes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it's Lisa. That's ours.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How many grades does this school have?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who shall I say is calling?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's your sister.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What? Why? Oh, yeah. Hello Patty, hello Selma. How was your trip?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, haven't you finished that stupid letter yet?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, where's the extension cord?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry. I'm just a big kid and I love Christmas so much.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,...Every year.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A what!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah. If you want one, you'll have to pay for it out of your own allowance.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Y'ello.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who's this?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This is her sister, isn't it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, kids. Prepare to be dazzled. Marge! Turn on the juice!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What do you think, kids?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What is it, Flanders?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's too bright. That Flanders, what a big show-off.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Spill it, Marge. Where have you been hiding the Christmas money?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh! Big jar this year.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mm-hmm... Mmm-hmm... Mmm-hmm...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, thank God for the big jar.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey! What's with this?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's true. The jar's empty. Oh, my God, we're ruined. Christmas is cancelled. No presents for anyone.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah my Christmas bonus. How silly of me. This'll be the best Christmas yet. The best any family ever had. Heh-heh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh. I love you, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, good. Because I do love you and I don't deserve you as much as a guy with a fat wallet and a credit card that won't set off that horrible beeping.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, well, let me be honest with you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well... I want to do the Christmas shopping this year.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, Marge, Marge. Let's see. Oooh, look! Pantyhose. Practical and alluring. A six-pack... Oh! Only four ninety nine.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh... pads of paper. I bet Bart can think of a million things to do with these. That just leaves little Maggie. Oh, look, a little squeak-toy. . It says it's for dogs, but she can't read...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, Flanders.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, let's see.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They're all yours.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gimme that!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, Moe.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What's with the crazy getup, Barn?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow. Can I do that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What do you mean? All the time? Even when they're nuts?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I certainly do.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Huh, when do we get paid?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dasher, Dancer...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Prancer...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nixon, Comet, Cupid... Donna Dixon.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And what would you like, little boy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little eggheaded...!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I knew that one, too.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not a word, Marge. I'm heading straight for the tub.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You both look well.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, well, Merry Christmas.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And why is that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I was just on my way out to get one.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, what do you think kids? Beauty, isn't it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's an ornament.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, son, you don't need all that junk. I'm sure you've already got something much more important, a decent home and a loving father who would do anything for you. Hey, I couldn't afford lunch. Gimme a bite of that donut.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I will when Mrs. Claus's sisters get out of town. Thanks for listening, kid.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What's your name, Bart... ner? -- Er -- Little partner?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm Jolly Old Saint Nick.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I want a word with you in Santa's Workshop, little boy. Cover for me, Elfie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nobody knows. It's a secret. I didn't get my bonus this year, but to keep the family from missing out on Christmas, I'd do anything.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now let's not get mushy, son. I still have a job to do.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, little ones, Santa's back. Ho! Ho!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Arrgh! -- Damn it to...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, son. One day you're gonna know the satisfaction of payday. Receiving a big fat check for a job well done.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Santa?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But... but...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thirteen bucks. We can't get anything for thirteen bucks.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, did you hear that? What a name -- ""Santa's Little Helper"". It's a sign! It's an omen!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Barney. I may be a total washout as a father, but I'm not gonna take my kid to some sleazy dog track on Christmas eve.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-uh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, okay. Let's go.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who's Tiny Tim?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I can't believe I'm doing this.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Barney, which one is Whirlwind?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What! That scrawny little bag of bones?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, you're right. I guess Whirlwind is our only hope for a Merry Christmas.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What are the odds on Santa's Little Helper?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whoa! Ninety-nine times thirteen equals MER-RY CHRISTMAS!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't you believe in me, son?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, boy. Sometimes your faith is all that keeps me going.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's my boy. Everything on Santa's Little Helper.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, Bart. Kiss the ticket for good luck, not that we need it. Heh-heh-heh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on Santa's Little Helper! Go, go, go! Run your tail off!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Go! Go!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't want to leave till our dog finishes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, forget it. Let's go.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Find any winners, son?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no you don't. No. No. Get away from me. Uh-uh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But he's a loser. He's pathetic. He's...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, look everybody. I have a confession to make.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I didn't get my Christmas bonus. I tried not to let it ruin Christmas for everybody, but no matter what I did, I just couldn't --",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It is?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Number eight. I mean, Santa's Little Helper.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lisa!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm warning you two!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,RUDOLPH WITH YOUR NOSE... OVER HERE... / SO YOU CAN GUIDE MY SLEIGH TODAY....,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmmmm. How could anyone make a word out of these lousy letters?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, wait! Here's a good one -- ""do"".",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey! No abbreviations!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, shut up, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We got one?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get outta here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute, you little cheater. You're not going anywhere until you tell me what a kwyjibo is.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll show you a big dumb balding ape!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's exactly the kind of crapola that's lousing him up. Hey, look at this! ""I am a weiner."" He sure is!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What have you done this time, boy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, it's a crummy system, but what are you gonna do?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no. He can't mean that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,My wife thinks you want me to pay for it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What do we need a psychiatrist for? We know our kid is nuts.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This lunkhead?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nine hundred and twelve?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, Bart, your mother's only trying to help. So go ahead and enjoy the show.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Doc, this is all too much. I mean, my son a genius -- how does it happen?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"How 'bout a tie, son? Everybody knows boy geniuses wear ties.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nonsense, Marge! Frosty Krusty Flakes are what got him where he is today.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It could be one of these chemicals here that makes him so smart. Lisa, maybe you should try some of this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm just saying, why not have two geniuses in the family? Sort of a spare in case Bart's brain blows up.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gotcha!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry son, you can have mine. Here, let me show you how to put on a tie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The hook goes over the top and these things go in there.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, there is nothing wrong with a father kissing his son, I think. Now go on, boy, and pay attention, because if you do, one day you may achieve something that we Simpsons have dreamed about for generations. You may outsmart someone.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, how was it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow! What are you readin' there? Comic books? Uh, guess you don't want to overheat the old noggin, eh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Tell you what: To celebrate your first day of genius school, whaddaya say we go out for a round of frosty chocolate milkshakes?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I'm not a genius. Why should I suffer?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Jeez. No beer... no opera dogs...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't stifle the boy, Marge. We're supposed to encourage him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who's the lard butt?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,P.U. When is this over?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Is that one fat enough for you, son?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let's go get a burger.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Bart. Your mother bought us tickets to a snooty movie directed by some Swedish meatball.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I guess we don't have to do that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Can it wait, son? It's getting kinda dark.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Can you still see the ball, Bart?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you don't think so, eh? Well, here comes some real heat.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So what was it you wanted to tell me, son?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I bet it's nothing a little turpentine won't take off. Come on, son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't be discouraged, son. I bet Einstein turned himself all sorts of colors before he invented the light bulb.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What is it, son?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why, you little -- !",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You can't stay in there forever!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,March your butt right out here. Now!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But -- son, if you don't come out I can't ""hug"" you... and ""kiss you""... and make you feel all better.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nothin's easy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, I defy anyone to tell the difference between these donuts and ones baked today. Hey, my boy's s'posed to be here any second on a field trip. They been through here yet?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're right! I gotta get where the action is!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Comin' through.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, hi, boy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But, sir, I --",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Those perfectionists? Forget it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm no Supervising Technician. I'm a Technical Supervisor. I've never done anything worthwhile in my life. I'm a big worthless nothing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're right! I'm young, I'm able-bodied, and I'll take anything. Watch out, Springfield, here I come.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm just a Technical Supervisor who cared too much.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You'll get that punk someday, Moe.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe, I think I'll have another -- -- Whoops. Moe, I'm a little low on funds. You think could cover me just this once?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why not? I think after all these years I deserve an explanation.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm fine. I'm just thinking.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You think you can still do that kind of work?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Beer! Now there's a temporary solution.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There must be some beer here somewhere... Ah, maybe in here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Damn!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I need money!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no, what have I done? I smashed open my little boy's piggy bank, and for what? A few measly cents. Not even enough to buy one beer. Wait a minute, lemme count and make sure...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not even close.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Dear Family: I am an utter failure and you'll be better off without me. By the time you read this, I will be in my watery grave. I can only leave you with the words my father gave me: 'Stand tall, have courage and never give up.' I only hope I can provide a better model in death than I did in life. Warmest regards, Love Homer J. Simpson.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Almost there.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you idiot! Watch where you're going!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, live and learn.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, this intersection is dangerous! Someone ought to put a stop sign here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kill myself? Killing myself is the last thing I'd ever do. Now I have a purpose, a reason to live. I don't care who I have to face. I don't care who I have to fight. I will not rest until this street gets a stop sign.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wouldn't want to run into him in a dark alley,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed Councilmen, boys and girls, retired people with nothing better to do. Danger comes in many, many forms, from the dinosaurs that tormented our cavemen ancestors to the --",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I think we should put a stop sign at D Street and Twelfth. The other --,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow. They listened to me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, if they think I'm gonna stop at that stop sign, they're sadly mistaken.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Proud. Proud of what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, what a great family! But come on, we all know this is small potatoes. There is a danger in this town that is bigger than all the dips put together.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm talking about that!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What did you say, son?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's okay. I'll just assume you said what I thought I heard you say.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thank you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Unlike most of you, I am not a nut. Just a good, honest American who opposes wrongdoing and especially carelessness wherever they occur.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Our lives are in the hands of men no smarter than you or I. Many of them, incompetent boobs. I know this because I have worked along side them, gone bowling with them, watched them pass me over for promotions time and again. And I say, this stinks!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Privately?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Same here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, no can do!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Safety? But, sir, if truth be known, I actually caused more accidents around here than any other employee. There were even a few doozies no one ever found out about.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey! What's the problem here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Me in charge of safety? This place could blow sky-high. Nah. I'll concentrate on my work now. Gee, this guy's desk sure is big. I can't let Marge support the family. This guy's got the cleanest shirt I've ever seen. What should I...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Umm... What the hey. I'll take the job.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ladies and gentlemen, this plant is --",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, sit tight. I'll be right back.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I can't do it, Mr. Burns.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmm. When you put it that way, it does sound a little far-fetched. But that's the lug you're looking at. And I vow to continue spending every free minute I have crusading for safety. Of course, I'd have a lot less of those free minutes if you gave me the job.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll get to work. But first I have to say goodbye to some friends.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But, don't worry. I've just been appointed the new safety inspector at this very plant...with a big fat raise!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whoa! Easy! Don't drop me! Be careful.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You were? Aw, well go ahead.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, you'd better get this all out of your system right now. I don't want you embarrassing me at my boss's picnic.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmmm! Marshmallow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm trying to get at least some of the unfortunate noises out of my system while I can, Marge. I don't want to embarrass myself at the company picnic.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you sure that's enough? You know how the boss loves your delicious gelatin desserts.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, that's the only time he's ever spoken to me without using the word ""bonehead"".",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There it is, kids... Stately Burns Manor. Heaven on earth.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, now look. My boss is gonna be at this picnic, so I want you to show your father some love and/or respect.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Afternoon, Mr. Burns.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Simpson, Homer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't correct the man, Brat. Oh, Boss, look what we brought... gelatin desserts.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why you, listen to me you...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, heh, heh, heh. Just congratulating the son on a fine joke about his old man.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, remember, as far as anyone knows, we're a nice, normal family.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Be normal! Be normal!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart! Lisa! Maggie!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Where are you, kids?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gotcha!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge! Knock it off!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is it used?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You remember the rules from last year?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart! No! No! No, no! Oh no, Bart, No! Don't! Noooo!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I need you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Snap out of it, Marge. You've got to come with me--the boss is going to make a toast!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, you picked a perfect time to start.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wahhhhhhhhh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Quick, Bart, give me a kiss.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, please. Five bucks for a kiss.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, I'm glad that's over. Now we can go home and act normal again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh come on. That cornball routine. ""I love you, Daddy."" Give me a break.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look everybody, yesterday was a real eye-opener. We've got to do better as a family. So tonight we're not going to shovel food in our mouths while we stare at the TV. We're going to eat at the dining room table like a normal family.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No. We're going to say grace first.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No! Ignore the boy, Lord. Now can the chatter and bow your heads. Dear Lord, thank you for this microwaved bounty, even though we don't deserve it. I mean, our kids are uncontrollable hellions... pardon my French... but they act like savages! Did you see them at the picnic? Oh, of course you did. You're everywhere. You're omnivorous. Oh, Lord, why did you smite me with this family?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No! I'm not done yet.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm sorry, Marge, but sometimes I think we're the worst family in town.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You think so, huh? Well, there's only one way to find out. Follow me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look at that, kids! No fighting, no yelling...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yahhhhhhhh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you think so? Well, let's see what's behind Door Number Two.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I wish I could hear what they're saying.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Probably to get the old man his pipe and slippers.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's worse than you think. I just trampled these poor saps' flower bed.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no. I want to be alone with my thought.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Another beer, Moe.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've got some wieners in my pocket.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, Moe, my Mom once said something that really stuck with me. She said, ""Homer, you're a big disappointment,"" and, God bless her soul, she was really onto something.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You can't talk that way about my kids. Or, at least two of them.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Why, you... Here's five you haven't met.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh... what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle. Heh-heh. They're on TV!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, time for a family meeting!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, look, you know and I know this family needs help. Professional help. So I made us an appointment with Dr. Marvin Monroe.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boxing, Lisa, boxing. There's a world of difference.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Honey, I've given this matter a lot of study. And of all the commercials I saw, his was the best. All it costs is two hundred and fifty dollars.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, then, we're just going to have to dig deep. Marge, go get the kids' college fund.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, come on, Marge. Why scrimp now on the off-chance that they'll actually get in someplace?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's it? That's the college fund we've been saving for all these years?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, we're not licked yet. To save this family, we're gonna have to make the supreme sacrifice.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, I appreciate that, honey, but we need one hundred and fifty dollars here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Would you pay one hundred fifty dollars for this lovely Motorola?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ready as she'll ever be!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, no pain, no gain.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Cash, of course. I've got two hundred and fifty dollars right here with me. I'm holding it right now. Here it is. Look. Check it out. Two hundred and fifty big ones.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lisa!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whoops. Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Good idea.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute. These mallet things are padded with foam rubber. What's the point?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Unortho what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Arrrgh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yes, doctor.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Arrrgh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Arrrgh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Arrrgh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute, Doc! Your TV commercial said family bliss, or double our money back!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow! Five hundred smackers!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That piece of junk? Forget it! We're going to get a new TV! Twenty-one-inch screen... realistic flesh tones... and a little cart so we can wheel it into the dining room on holidays!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do I smell cupcakes?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooo, Do I ever!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ah. Say no more.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, you're saying butt kisser like it's a bad thing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, you see, boy. It never hurts to grease the wheels a little.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Surely, Lisa. You see how it works, Bart? A cupcake here, a good grade there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, right, Lis. It's the three roads to success, Bart. Work, brains, and...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, and I got the day off from work.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But what's a day off from work when I'm never gonna see my beloved son again. Oh, Bart. Oh, Bart.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Tough day at school, boy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So you had a little scuffle, eh? Hope you won.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, your mother has the fool idea that you're upset about something.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, Bart, we don't want your mother to see you crying. Here, let me help you dry those tears.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, what's the problem, son?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, Marge. I don't bug you when you're helping Lisa.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What? And violate the code of the school yard? I'd rather Bart died.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The code of the School yard, Marge! The rules that teach a boy to be a man. Let's see... Don't tattle... Always make fun of those different from you... Never say anything unless you're sure everyone feels exactly the same way you do... Hmmm, what else... ?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, right! This ought to be good for a laugh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, thank you very much, Mrs. Maharishi Gandhi. Let's go, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Now here's that bully of yours. Show me your stuff.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no! Not like that! Like this!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"See, that boy? You didn't expect that, did you? And neither will he.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Unfortunately, son, we Simpsons sometimes have to bend the rules a little in order to hold our own.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So the next time this bully thinks you're gonna throw a punch, you throw a glob of mud in his eyes, and then you sock him when he's staggering around, blinded...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And there's nothing wrong with hitting someone when his back is turned.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And if you get the chance, get 'em right in the family jewels. That little doozy's been a Simpson trademark for generations.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Awright, you kids, keep it down! Am I making myself... ?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You, up in the tree! The tall grayÂ­ haired kid! Get your butt down here right now!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What about you, boy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cupcakes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not now, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa! Lisa, are you still in there? What's the problem? Did you fall in? Lisa!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wha' th--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Where the hell are my keys? Who stole my keys? Come on, I'm late for work.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The den! Great idea!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Do you know where my keys are?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Rumpus room. Great idea!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right. Hey, hey!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, come on. Let's go.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Must you do this every time?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no! I'm not down, I'm -- get up, you! Get up! Come on!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay. Here we go.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Get out of the way! How come he's not ducking? Ugh! Wait a minute, I can't get my... Get out of the way, stupid!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ohhh... get out of the corner!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What did you do this time, you little hoodlum? Oop. Get out of the way.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lisa?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Lisa refuses to play dodge ball because she is sad."" Well, she doesn't look sad. I don't see any tears in her eyes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, sure I would, princess. I have feelings, too. You know, like ""my stomach hurts"" or ""I'm going crazy"". Why don't you climb up on Daddy's knee and tell him all about it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well... eh... er...eh...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, Lisa... ride the Homer horsey. Giddiyap! Whee!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thanks for knowing I mean well.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're right. Bart, vacuum this floor!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"In times of trouble, you got to go with what you know. Now hop to it, boy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no, come on! Don't let that boy -- get out of the... Oh, no, not again! Don't. Don't. Don't. Great, get over. Oh, geeze.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I am not. It's just that I couldn't concentrate with that infernal racket. Lisa! Lisa!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, what did I tell you about playing that saxamathing in the house?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to yell. Go ahead -- play your blues if it'll make you happy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Let's hear it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You just clack as loud as you want. Lis.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What th...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, go easy on me. I'm your Dad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, Bart, no.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know Marge, getting old is a terrible thing. I think the saddest day of my life is when I realized I could beat my dad at most things. And Bart experienced that at the age of four. So why are you still awake?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, so that's it. This is some kind of underwear thing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no, Marge!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, are you all right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Then you've heard. Oh, God. What are we doing to do? The lanes were kinda warped but, oh, the food!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh. Me, too.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gimme some quarters. I'm doing my laundry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where's the video boxing?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, that kid's pretty good.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, me! No, Me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Listen -- can you teach me to fight like you do?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, come on.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You little... Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's okay. With the tips you've given me, I'm going to pound the tar out of a certain little smarty pants tonight.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Excuse me. I think I hear my wife calling.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just try not to kill me too hard, son. Heh-heh-heh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kid, tonight's not your night.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh! Oh! Block it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ha ha! I got you. Don't try that. I got ya. I'll block you. And the crowd is on its feet as Hurricane Homer moves in for the kill.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Quiet, Marge. This is my big moment.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart-the-bloody-pulp Simpson is on the ropes. He's hoping I'll put him out of his misery. Well, you're in luck, Bart, here comes my right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, noooo!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"My game! My game! I coulda beat the boy! Marge, how could you? I was so close.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just be happy with what you got, son. Don't try to keep up with the Flanderses.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart! I suppose it has..uh..various features?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A satellite dish!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But how can you afford something like this, Ned? I get your mail once in a while... you make only twenty-seven dollars a week more than I do.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oooh! Credit.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'd like to see your finest RV. Do you have something that's better than the Land Behemoth?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where is it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Does it have a deep fryer?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait till Flanders gets a load of this.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, how much is it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, how much is it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You do?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is that a good siren? Am I approved?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't you have something that isn't out of my price range? I don't want to go away empty-handed, Bob.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How much do you want for it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I swear it Bob.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,On my honor.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, well, I don't know. Would it be alright if I conferred with my family?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right. All right! I'll take it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey Flanders! Look what I got!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Jealous. Everybody ready?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"that's the spirit. Ready or not, nature here we come!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lisa!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll tell you when we get there. Go back to your smell game.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pfft. Maps.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't worry. This is an all-terrain vehicle.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, come on. We're going back to nature.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What do you think? Should we stop here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All righty.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, here we are!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, nobody move. Nobody panic. When I give the word, everyone ever so slowly open your door and slide out. On the count of three. One...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, heh heh, now we get a chance to be real pioneers.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes sir! This is a real adventure. Why, I bet there are people who would trade everything they have in the world for an adventure like this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Will somebody help her?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now don't worry. Our situation isn't as bad as it seems. And you're forgetting, I'm an experienced woodsman. Now you all stay here for a minute while I go over this way and try to get my bearings.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What am I going to do? I've murdered us all.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shut up!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,There! Finished.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, it's a quick job, but it's shelter.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh-huh. Okay, we'll be back with help before you know it. You girls just stay here and relax.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's nice, Lisa, but we're not in astronomy class. We're in the woods.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, might be a few. But don't worry about it. If you leave them alone, they'll leave you alone.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And remember not to act afraid. Animals can smell fear. And they don't like it. Besides, there's nothing to be afraid of.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A rattler!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Run, you fool!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Through here, boy. Back to civilization.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"When you're an experienced woodsman like me, you get a feel for these things. It becomes natural. Like a third sense.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart? Where are you, Bart?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,His lucky red hat! Oh dear God! No! Bart!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart! Oh Bart! Bart, Bart! Oh, Bart, my beautiful son. Why couldn't you have taken me? Of all the fates of heaven and earth, why did this one befall me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What the--? You're alive!... and... buck nekkid.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What? Oooh! Jungle Man!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The first thing you learn about surviving in the woods, boy: Conceal your nakedness.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, slap a fern on there, boy. Now, some mud. There. Ooh! That requires a little mollusk. And mollusk for me. All right. We're ready to hit the town.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah food. Good thinking, son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This young sapling ought to do the trick.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No. This is a trap. It's going to catch us our dinner. Come on, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shhhh! Just watch.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, ahh. Ha! Got him!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay. This time I'll just go into those bushes over there, make a lot of noise and flush out a rabbit. When he comes out, you step on him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get 'em off me! Get 'em off! Aaah!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"G-g-good night, s-son. S-sleep tight.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How would I know. Quit asking pointless... Bart look!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Honey! Honey! We're saved!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Tangy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wah-neh! Wah-neh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wah neh! Wah neh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pleehhh! Hnnnn! Plem! Feh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Femmmmm! Wah! Gnnn! Hrmmerhrr!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Plemk heh feh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just a little farther... just a little further... just a little further. Food!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nice grizzles. Nice grizzles. Nice grizzles.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Praise the grizzles son.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maggie! Oh my little girl!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nice grizzly, nice grizzly.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Avenge me, son. Avenge my death.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Can I have some apple sauce?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge. The guys at work are going to have a field day with this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, those stupid eggheads.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, Bart, when I was your age, I pulled a few boners, but I think you'll find that people are pretty decent if you give them half... Oh, oh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"They've got us cornered, boy. We'll never get away. Give me the head.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, we're in this mess together. No matter how tempting it might be, I can't let my only boy get ripped limb from limb by a blood-thirsty mob.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We'll die together, like a father and son should.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get him!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh no.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No we don't. Try being objective for once in your... oooh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But you don't understand, Marge. I have fifty bucks riding on this game.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This isn't gambling, Marge. It's a lead pipe cinch.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh no!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where is it. The game... where is it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ah!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Catch it! catch it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Lazar who?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh no, no. We stink, we stink!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Maybe.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Make it, make it, make it, make it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's good! It's good! It's good!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's good to see you all in church.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What? Oh yeah. You were great.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What was it about?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh! He didn't by any chance say that under certain circumstances it was all right, did he?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What! Those cute little monkeys? That's terrible. Who told you that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I can understand how they wouldn't let in those wild jungle apes, but what about those really smart ones who live among us -- who roller skate and smoke cigars?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge. They're only space mutants.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I hope you're not planning to see a certain movie starring certain space mutants that a certain mother didn't want you to see?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here you go, son. Share the wealth, that's what I always say.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow! Look at these bowling balls, Maggie. Can you think of a better way for Daddy to spend his hard won fifty bucks?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now I've seen everything. Black marbleized with a liquid center. The ""Stealth Bowler"" -- the pins don't know what hit 'em.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sure, boy. What's on your mind?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm glad you asked, son. Being popular is the most important thing in the world.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You're not talking about killing anyone, are you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Then run along you little scamp. A boy without mischief is like a bowling ball without a liquid center.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh. Look at this one. ""The Hammer of Thor. It will send your pins to Valhalla."" Lisa?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooooh, that's some ball.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just a statue? Is the Statue of Liberty just a statue? Is the Leaning Tower of Piza just a statue?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I knew it all along.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah? Why you little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lay off the boy, Marge. He's a good kid. Quit givin' him the third degree.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, maybe I am a little responsible.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, son. Let's take the head thing back to the authorities.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, Bart, when I was your age, I pulled a few boners, but I think you'll find that people are pretty decent if you give them half... Oh, oh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good going, son. But remember, most lynch mobs aren't this nice.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh? Whuh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My birthday?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's my birthday? What did I get? I love birthdays.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Of course I know! Sure! You really thought I forgot, didn't you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Huh... a very thoughtful gift. But it's a surprise. You know, it's such a beautiful morning, I think I'll take a little stroll around the block.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no. Come on, come on! Open up!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ah... no.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Too salty...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ummm, nah...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hmmm. Nah, too corny...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Too exciting.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmmmm!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Be right there.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, sounds delightful. Just you and me and the balladeers.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fair enough.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What's that, Patty?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hold on! Hold on now! Your mother hasn't opened my present yet.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Whoop! Don't worry, this frosting'll come right off. Beauty, isn't she?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, if you don't want it, I know someone who does.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You always say we should talk. I'm talking right now, as a matter of fact. But I'm going to stop in a second. So, please say something back, Marge, please. I'm gonna stop talking... now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What? No...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I wanted to surprise you. I couldn't very well chop your hand off and bring it to the store, could I?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, if that's how you feel, I'll take it back.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So you'd know it's from me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What? But you don't know how to bowl!... whoops.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well... you're welcome.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now this is living, eh, kids? Hot pizza... the food of kings.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, I'm not scared. I think it's a great chance to spend some time with you kids. Your mother always gets to be alone with you, and now it's my turn. Does the time always drag like this?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay. We've eaten, and eaten well. Now, what else do we have to do? Well, let's check the list your mom left us.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eat, mm-hm.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh. Clean up. Now don't worry, everybody, this'll be a breeze if we all pitch in.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, we're clean. Now we'll... put Maggie to bed.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ahhh... ahhh... Oh, how was bowling?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sport, dear, it's a sport, you silly thing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh? You're going back?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, no, I don't mind.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,'Night.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nothing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,For Marge?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, I don't know if I can lift my head, let alone a ball.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, sorry... ouch!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I gave you advice? Get outta here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmm. Good advice.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, may I speak to you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, I've been thinking... Everyone makes peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but usually the jelly drips out over the sides and a guy's hands get all sticky. But your jelly stays right in the middle where it's supposed to. I don't know how you do it. You've just got a gift, I guess. I've always thought so. I just never mentioned it. But it's time you knew how I feel. I don't believe in keeping feelings bottled up. ...Goodbye, my wife.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Starving.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How can I eat it? She made it. It's all I have left.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What a lovely surprise! You're here to see me, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Tell him I'm going to the back seat of my car with the woman I love. And I won't be back for ten minutes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it was delightful. The frosting on the cake was this thick. And Eugene Fisk, my poor sucker of an assistant, didn't know the fruit punch was spiked. And he really made an ass of himself putting the moves on the new girl in Valve Maintenance.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Pffft. I have to warn you, Marge -- I think the poor young thing has the hots for yours truly.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just keepin' you on your toes, babe.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Two-hundred and thirty-nine pounds?! I'm a blimp! Why are all the good things so tasty? From now on, exercise every morning.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh no! Two-hundred and thirty-nine pounds. I'm a whale. Why was I was cursed with this weakness for snack treats? Well, from now on, exercise every morning, Homer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good idea, Marge. By the way, this Friday night I'm gonna be attending a little get-together with the boys at work. Eugene Fisk is marrying some girl in Valve Maintenance.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no, Marge. It's gonna be very classy, a tea-and-crumpets kind of thing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, my supervisor.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what is this? The Spanish Exposition?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart! What are you doing?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where am I... the Planet Cornball?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oooh... entertainment.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, shut up!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, look at him squirm.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm sorry, I don't usually laugh like this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, this is the most fun I've had in my whole life.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"One glazed and one scratch-and-win, please.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, buddy. You got me confused with Fred Flintstone.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, Liberty bell! Another liberty bell! One more and I'm a millionaire. Come on, Liberty bell! Please, please, please please, please please. That purple fruit thing! Where were you yesterday?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What are you on, pal?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, a doo dee doo doo to you, too, pint size!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Man, you get a lot of nutcases in here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I hear ya, buddy! Whew! Full moon!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmmm... still got it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I-it's meaningless, Marge. Don't even attempt to find meaning in it. There's nothing between me and Princess Kashmir.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Your photo?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little --,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look Marge... honey... baby doll... I...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What are you saying, Honey?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But where will I sleep?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Would a motel be okay?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, I knew you'd come to your...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Moe. My wife gave me the old heave-ho because of some lousy picture.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Motel, I guess.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, Barney. See the row of tiny lights up there? The middle one is my house. Someone must have left the porch light on.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Barney!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't listen to him, Marge, he's...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, Barn. I just want to crawl into bed.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh no.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What do you mean, sir?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It won't happen again, sir. I promise. May I get out of your sight now?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh... Mr. Burns, in spite of what everybody thinks, I'm no lover-boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't really know, sir.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well... Uh... Wine 'em, dine 'em, bring 'em flowers, write 'em love poetry, sir.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Anybody home?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How's your Mom?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, thanks, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, Marge. It's me. Homer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you still mad?... You are still mad. No need to say it. I'm your loving husband. I can read you like a book. I'll just have some milk.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, I'm not drinking out of the carton. Come on, Marge. Please forgive me? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yes I do. Because I'm hungry... my clothes are smelly... and I'm tired.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, he does not!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So what should I do, Marge?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay. Your wish is my command, my little...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You see, I'm trying to teach my son here about treating woman as objects.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Forget that. I'm teaching my boy a lesson. Is she here or not?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge. Marge. We're gonna try one more place. The Sapphire Lounge. Bart! I said look at the floor!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There she is! Hey, Princess! It's me, the guy from the snap shot!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oooo.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, I'm here because I want to apologize for treating you like an object.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I also want my boy to find out that you're more than just a belly. I want him to meet the woman behind all the spangles and glitter and find out that she has thoughts and feelings, too.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Could you tell him a little about yourself?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Thank you very much ma'am. We'll be out of your...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh no.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ahhhhhh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,ABOUT A MILLION GIRLS.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hep... heyyy... whoooo... look out... yeah... Da da da da da.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Stop the music... Quiet please... I have something to say. Quiet!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Jeez, Louise. Look at this mess.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I told that boy a billion times to pick up his jun--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My back! There goes my back again!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Go get help, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Maggie. My poor back.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The boy. Bring me the boy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh Marge! I still hurt! Marge! Marge!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Actually, I was wondering if you could make me a grilled cheese sandwich?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Make sure it's squished flat and crunchy on the outside.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And maybe some of those little wieners that come in a can. Oh, and some fruit cocktail... in heavy syrup.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge! Marge! Marge! Get the door.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, hello Principal Skinner. I'd get up but the boy crippled me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That old gag.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hear him out, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sounds great, although a kid can't learn much in just three months.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but what about Bart?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute, Skinner. How do we know some principal over in France isn't pulling the same scam you are?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You mean all white with pink eyes?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He makes me crazy twelve months a year. At least you get the summer off.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bon voyage, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm gonna miss you, son. And listen... while you're seeing all those great sights, always remember that you're representing your country. I guess what I'm saying is, don't mess up France the way you messed up your room.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Goodbye, Bart.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Be good.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You gotta be kiddin'. The lek?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Give me the old stars and stripes.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Political what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Affectionate little Albanian, isn't he?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Please, please kids. Stop fighting. Maybe Lisa's right about America being a land of opportunity, and maybe Adil has a point about the machinery of capitalism being oiled with the blood of the workers.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Did you see that? You know, Marge, this is the way I've always wanted it to be. We've become a fully functioning family unit. We've always blamed ourselves, but I guess it's pretty clear which cylinder wasn't firing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, she's just jealous. She'll get over it, and if she doesn't, we can always exchange her.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just kidding.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nice and cozy, Adil?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, Adil. You can call me Dad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Aww. You called me dad.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You want to see where I work?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,None of my biological kids ever wanted to see me at work.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'll have to pull a few strings with the boys in Security, but sure, you bet.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"See these? American donuts. Glazed, powdered, and raspberry filled. Now how's that for freedom of choice?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... maybe. Hold on a second.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Lenny. Does this place have one of those plutonium isolation deals?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sector Twelve?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that Sector Twelve.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come along, Adil.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You little shutterbug.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cheese!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, he sure makes life a lot easier around here. You have to admit that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay. I love Bart. Well...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Darn tootin'.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Honey, I'm home.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, just some blueprints Adil wanted. I'm telling you, he's such a curious little dickens. I bet he could build a nuclear power plant if he wanted to.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, trouble in the neighborhood. Let's check it out.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm his neighbor, what'd he do?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oooo.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Aw!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmmm.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gee whiz. Adil would get a kick out of seeing this.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Adil! Oh... there you are.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ouch! Watch it! Hey. Ow, Ouch!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So, he's going to prison?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Goodbye, Adil. I'll send you those civil defense plans you wanted.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"He needs me. Hey, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Marge. Some wiseguy stuck a cork in the bottle.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Did you hear that, Marge? My boy speaks French.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Y'ello.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, premium -- wait a minute. Why?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"How you doin', Apu?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mmm, chocolate... oooh, double chocolate... New flavor! Triple chocolate!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Perhaps a little something for the trip back to the cash register.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The reason I look unhappy is that tonight I have to see a slide show starring my wife's sisters -- or as I call them, ""the gruesome twosome.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, pal...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And he had a big nose.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, bigger. And big red hair that came out to... yeah, yeah like that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah. Wait a minute. It's the guy from TV. My kid's hero... Cruddy... Crummy... Krusty the Clown!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, uh... m-maybe you better run off to bed...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, sir.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, if the crime is making me laugh, they're all guilty.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, definitely number... Heh heh...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Four.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm home everybody.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh fantastic. Marge, you're never gonna believe what happened. I was down at the Kwik-E-Mart minding my own business when... Oooh oooh, ooh, the news.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute. Bart -- you know that guy on your lunch box?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"He's sort of a hero of yours, isn't he?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The reason I look unhappy is that tonight I have to see a slide show starring my wife's sisters -- or as I call them, ""the gruesome twosome.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Earth to Marge. Earth to Marge. I was there... the clown's G-I-L-L -T-Y.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, son. You'll understand one day.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, sir.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, I do.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I'm not. I'm hopping on the bandwagon. Now come on, son, get with the winning team.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Krusty, I'm man enough to admit I was wrong, and I'm sorry I fingered you in court. I sincerely hope that the horrible stories I heard about what goes on in prison are exaggerated.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oooh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ahhhh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, turn it up. I love hearing those whack-os.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't be ridiculous. My wife worships the ground I walk on.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I hope you do find that punk someday, Moe. Fill 'er up.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Let's just say, I don't feel like goin' home tonight. Jar, please.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You might say that. My wife's gonna leave me 'cause she thinks I'm a pig.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What? Hey, Barney, am I a pig?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Gee, a romantic evening. Nah, she's too smart to fall for that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I read you loud and clear.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh... I'd like some flowers.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, you know, pretty ones. Like that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"One, please.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,...and I've made reservations at the Chez Paree.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It matters not, mon frere. And after desserts, we'll adjourn to our second-floor room at the Off Ramp Inn.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oops.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, this is Mr... Sampson.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No. I said Sampson, not Simpson.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"BA, BA / BA, BA, BA, BA BA, BA, BA, BA, BA, BA / BA, BA BA!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"BA, BA / BA BA, BA, BA BA, BA, BA BA, BA, BA...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, one day you'll learn to move like your old man.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, there's not a woman alive who can resist a man who knows how to mambo.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Out, boy, out.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Smooth as a baby's behind.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I think you're right, dumplin'.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"BART, GET THE DOOR!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, don't just stand there, boy. Help Miss Botz with her suitcases.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bye kids. Watch out for the boy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,They all look so tasty. But I think I'll eat this one right there.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, okay. Then I'll take that one there with the beady eyes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oui, oui. After you. And I'll be seeing you later.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Because I'm so carefree?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,More champagne?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ooops. Time for a fill-up. GarÃ§on! Another bottle of your second-least-expensive champagne.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, Marge, this is just like when we were dating.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't forget to tell me when you see the off-ramp.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No problemo. We'll just get off at the next exit.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, Marge. Let me carry you over the threshold.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sheesh, eleven years ago, and you've never forgotten it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, your blue thing with the things?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, shake a leg, Mama.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whoa!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmmm.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right. I suppose my work here is done.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't like the looks of this.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ms. Botz? Ms. Botz?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Good Lord! What have those little hellions done now?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We're so sorry, we're so sorry.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, these things are heavy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just so there's no hard feelings, here's double your pay. No, no, triple.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sure.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ain't that the truth. You know, one time he --",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just a minute, young man. I don't know what kind of shenanigans you've been pulling this time, but I just had to untie your babysitter and pay her off so that --",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The what?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh... uh... no. Are you sure this microphone works? Uh, well, I wouldn't say I aided her. This is on, right? Because, actually, it was quite a struggle.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Have you ever seen a Kung Fu movie? It was just like that. But now I know her moves. So, if you're listening to me, lady, you better think long and hard before trying something like this on Homer Simpson again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lord help me, I'm just not that bright.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah. Yeah!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Honey, can we make up again?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eww, I hate that icky soup skin.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mmmm. Marge, Could you get me another beer, please?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sure I do. I just want to have a beer while I'm caring. Marge...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What! You did! Well, that's just... oh, what a glorious day! Lisa, hand me your paper.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm just gonna take this over to the refrigerator and, hmmm. Well as long as I'm here, I might as well kill two birds with one stone.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Look at those funny little whiskers. Oooo! That reminds me. It's Big Gorilla Week on Million Dollar Movie. C'mon boy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, ""Gorilla, The Conqueror."" The granddaddy of them all.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's so unfair... just because he's different.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Burning the candle at both ends, eh boy? Go get 'em.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Psst... Marge. Come take a look at this.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Just a little dim, I guess.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I wish I had Amoria Phlebitis.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I have hair!... I have hair!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Dr. J.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,I was right.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Miracle breakthrough! There's been a miracle breakthrough?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hair... hair... Just like everybody else.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, weren't you listening? This is a miracle breakthrough. Not one of these cheapo sucker deals.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Great! Great! Great! How much? How much? How much?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A thousand bucks. I can't afford that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"A thousand bucks. Of all the rip-off -- screw job -- gyp joint... forget you, pal! Thanks for nothing!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So I say ""Forget you, pal! Thanks for nothing!"", and I storm right outta there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Out of tartar sauce.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"They call this a portion? Hey Lenny, are you gonna use all your tartar sauce? Dry fish sticks. This sucks.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If I had hair, you wouldn't be calling me that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But it's a thousand bucks... Burns would can my butt in no time flat.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nothing... well, that newsletter.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You got me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, I'd like to charge that Dimoxinil stuff to my health insurance?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good morning, Springfield! Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. Winfield!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good morning, Moe's Tavern!",,,,,

Homer Simpson,Gimme the usual.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Daddy's home, Sugar!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, dinner with three beautiful women. I must be in heaven.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"No, no, that'll be fine, thank you, goodbye.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hello?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Marge, every woman I iÂ­nÂ­tÂ­eÂ­rview for the secretary job makes kissy faces at me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll call you back, Marge.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,Hello?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I love you, Karl -- Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, sir, for one thing we had a problem every Tuesday, when the cafeteria would serve fish sticks.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, sir, they cut the head off a fish and chop up the rest into sticks, and then put seasoned bread crumbs on them.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, you only get this tiny little cup of tartar sauce to dip it in and I always run out.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Enjoy your tartar sauce, boys! Enjoy! Give me your plates. Don't crowd. Plenty for everybody.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The key!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sure thing, Mr. Burns.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Can do, sir.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Rainy day. There's never gonna be a be a rainy day, Marge. There's not a cloud in the Simpson sky. And what does my little girl want?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yea... eh... how about a pony?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, well okay, what the hey?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Karl, you gotta help me. Mr. Burns wants me to make some speech to his executives and -- what do you want?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You did?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Karl, you saved me. Why?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, thanks, Karl. I don't know what to say.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bye, Karl. I'm gonna miss you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, what are you doing?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ahhhh!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Boy must die.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Dirty trick. Okay, I'm not gonna kill you, but I'm gonna tell you three things that are gonna haunt you for the rest of your days. You ruined your father. You've crippled your family, and baldness is hereditary.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I don't have a thousand bucks! But you do, don't you, Marge? You do... you do. You've been squirreling it away, haven't you? Saving it for a rainy day, that's what you said, right? Right? Right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Karl! So that wasn't just a sweet voice I heard inside my head. What are you doing here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, well, thanks for the speech, Karl, but I can't give it. Look at me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What do you mean?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I can't. I'm just a big fool.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How do you know?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Karl.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A lot of you would think I was crazy if I did this.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yet we at this power plant are doing this every hour of every day. Bloated inventories, outmoded production methods -- I can save this company millions of dollars a year. How? Through Jiko Kanri, the Japanese art of self-management. You see, in the West... the long term benefits more than offsetting the one-time cost... for a net savings of...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Five thousand two... I mean... Lots of money.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, why?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know... a hundred and two?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What! Oh thank you, thank you, thank you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, better hurry up.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I've never been more awake in my life.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Are you kidding? I'm stuck in that dead-end job again. The kids are gonna hate me cause I can't buy them all that stuff I promised 'em, and you're not gonna love me as much cause I'm ugly and bald.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And... and?! What about loving me?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'M EVERYTHING YOU NEED /,,,,,
Homer Simpson,HOMER MARGE,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"to me.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oooo! What a haul this year. I love Halloween.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute. Let's see what the kids are up to.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There you are, my man. And a dollar for yourself.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh? Well... it's all ours!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Motivated seller, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So we got a good deal for once. Quit fighting it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Probably just the house settling.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, a vortex.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Catch.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey! Pretty slick!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay boy, let's see you talk yourself out of this one.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Quiet, Lisa. You're scaring your mother.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now wait a minute, Marge. It's only natural there would be some things wrong with an old house like this. It's a fixer-upper. What's the problem? we get a bunch of priests in here...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't be so stubborn! We're not talking about a few dollars! We're talking about a few thousand dollars!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's got great high ceilings.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Tell you what -- let's sleep on it. Okay?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What could happen?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,They are all against me! They all must die!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge! Oh, Marge!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, come on, Marge. You said you'd sleep on it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,An ancient Indian what...?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Ploot? Homer Simpson here. When you sold me this house you forgot to mention one little thing. You didn't tell me it was built on an Indian burial ground. No you didn't! Well, that's not my recollection... Yeah! Well... all right, goodbye. He says he mentioned it five or six times.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, gee, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not to worry. I'll just turn on the trusty bug zapper.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Better than your eyes bursting. Ewww!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooo! That was a big mama. Heh, heh, heh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That should just about do it. Man alive, there's nothing better than a hamburger grilled to perfection...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"The burgers are getting cold, guys. Holy moly.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey! Get a load of that spread.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Smothered pork chops.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The girl's right. Let's get some applesauce out here for these pork chops.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What are you lookin' at, buddy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, thanks.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge and I played that old game before we were married.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, a feast.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Tell us more about this feast.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, she's right.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Listen, you big stupid space creature. Nobody, but nobody eats the Simpsons.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't play dumb with me. We found your book.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, thanks Lisa.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"'Tis some visitor,",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Lenore.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Aag!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sir --,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Surely --,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou --",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"-- art sure no craven, Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore -- Tell me... tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ouch! Censer..,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wretch --,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"-- thy God hath lent thee -- by these angels he hath sent thee. Respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore! Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore! Oh, leave no black plume as a token of the lie thy soul hath spoken! Leave my loneliness unbroken! -- quit the bust above my door! Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little --!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come back here now, Raven",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh no, Marge. Come on, please.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh... oh, I hate Halloween.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mary Bailey. Well, if I was governor, I'd sure find better things to do with my time.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Like getting Washington's birthday and Lincoln's birthday back as separate paid holidays. President's Day! Pfft. What a rip-off! I bust my butt day in and day out --,,,,,
Homer Simpson,So... Someone will punch in for me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll mutant you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, man. Plain cake donuts? Thanks for taking all the fancies, guys. Why can't I ever get here on time?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, uh, just resting my eyes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ah! Uh... I'm just resting my eyes. Holy moly! Nine-thirty.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, Marge. Sorry I didn't call but it's been a madhouse down here... Yeah, these twelve hour days are killin' me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Echo, echo...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Huh? What th... Uh, Mr. Burns?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, sir. It's just me, Homer Simpson. Is everything all right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh... uh yes, sir.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooooh, cushy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, nobody's perfect.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, I was just telling the wife that if I was governor, I'd do things a lot differently.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I bet you could afford it, though.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh... don't get me wrong. I mean you're an honest man. I just meant that you could afford to run for governor, if you felt like it. 'Course I'm just rambling because... uh... because you keep staring at me like that, but, but it's true. I mean, if you were governor, you could decide what's safe and what isn't.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Where are we going, sir?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If it's on the way, could you drop me off at my house?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, he's got my vote.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mary Bailey isn't going to fire me if I don't vote for her. I'm for Monty Burns.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge. What's the big deal? I bet before the papers blew this out of proportion, you didn't even know how many eyes a fish had.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I hope Burns and I can count on your support, honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not yet, son. Not yet.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah... great toast, Marge. Hmmm. Oh, by the way, the night before the election Mr. Burns is coming over for dinner.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And some reporters and camera crews, but you don't need to feed them.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kids, please leave the room. I don't want you to see this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge! Don't worry. My daughter's very bright, I'm sure she'll be able to memorize your question by dinner time tomorrow.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, get back in bed.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's wrong? I just want to snuggle.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's that got to do with it?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But you do get to express yourself. In the lovely home you keep, and the food you serve.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey! Hello, handsome!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bad dog! Bad neighbor dog! Here, let me help you up, Mr. Burns.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Are you all right, Mr. Burns?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, would you like to say grace?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""You know, Mr. Burns, my family and I feel that taxes are too high. Where do you stand on this highly controversial issue?""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I was only reading what the card...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, Mr. Burns... Uh, Mr. Burns...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh. My dreams will go unfulfilled! Oh no. I don't like the sound of that one bit. That means I have nothing to hope for. Marge, make it better. Please. Can't you make it better, huh?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you did it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, Barney.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, there's only one thing worse than being a loser. It's being one of those guys who sits in a bar telling the story of how he became a loser. And I never want that to happen to me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, okay. It all started on ""Nuclear Plant Employees, Spouses, and No More Than Three Children Night,"" down at Springfield stadium.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, boy, some of the players you see tonight may make it to the big leagues, one day.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sure, we get a nice mix here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, honey, you're forgetting the beer. It comes in seventy-two ounce tubs here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What are you getting at?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, this ticket doesn't just give me a seat, it also gives me the right - no, the duty, to make a complete ass of myself.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh... Simp-sons, sir.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that's okay. The baby's name isn't important. Let's go, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What's the matter, boy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow! Flash Bailor came on to my wife! You've still got the magic, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whoa!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey everybody! How you doin'? Look at me! I'm Homer Simpson! Heh...heh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Examine my zipper? Why? Whoops!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, everybody.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Burns! Hey, ""Rag Arm""!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Let's go now... Sa-winggg, batter!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no. Marge, sitting next to the boss -- the best night of the year, and it's ruined! Of all the lousy, rotten... this stinks...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Rub it in.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Delicious frosty beer. Fat lot of good that does me, sitting next to old man Burns.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Me, sir? Oh, no. Not a chance. Only idiots drink beer.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ohhh. Well, if someone of your stature can enjoy a beer, maybe I'm all turned around on the subject. Wait a minute, we're not having a drug test tomorrow, are we?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good one, sir.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,LITTLE BABY BATTER / CAN'T CONTROL HIS BLADDER!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Will you shut up, I'm trying to think of a name.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't mind if I do.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, Burnsie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,C'mon! All we need is a grand slam.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What's wrong with you people? Let's show some spirit! Come on, get up!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Your team needs you! C'mon!!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"As I got up in front of them, I felt an intoxication that had nothing to do with alcohol. It was the intoxication of being a public spectacle.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I thank you. You're too kind. Glad you enjoyed it, but I can't take all the credit. The batter did his part, too.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,M-- me? A mascot for a bush league team?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I should have slept on it. Or at least stared blankly for a while. Perhaps if I'd been unable to think of a nickname, all our lives might have been spared.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm ready to punch in.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nope, this was my own bright idea. C'mon, we gotta hurry. Don't fill up on those vegetables, kids. Save room for your nachos.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"For the first time in my life, people weren't laughing at me, they were laughing towards me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie. Woo, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah? And where might that be? Oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Helen, I'm in a Caribbean mood tonight. How 'bout giving me ""Baby Elephant Walk"" with a little reggae kinda beat?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You wanted to see me, ""Tex""?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, oh, oh, I get it. You can't fire the players, so you fire the mascot. You make me sick.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Me? In the majors?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute, Capital City has a mascot. The greatest mascot there is: The Capital City ""Goofball"".",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll say!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Because they might say no.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This was the biggest decision the Simpsons ever faced. I should've listened to the kids instead of my big dumb wife.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I shouldn't have called her that. Bite my tongue. Bite my tongue. Oooh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It won't be so bad. You'll die someplace else.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Phfft. You'll make new and better friends.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You mean -- ?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's not that simple. I've got to convince my supervisor to give me a leave of absence.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's right, Ned.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, knock it off, Flanders! Don't start blubbering on me. I'm gonna miss you too... not.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"... Some may say that I have been given a bad break in life -- little education, bald as a cue ball, ten years on the same job for the same salary -- but today, as I leave for Capital City, I consider myself the luckiest mascot on the face of the Earth!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"With the fickle fans already forgetting me, I was ready to take the biggest step of my life.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well kids, there it is, Capital City.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Kids, look! Street crime!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow! That's service!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The Duff Brewery!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, honey. I'm just a little nervous.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We would talk about it always. For the first time in our lives, Marge fell asleep before I did.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, here are your tickets. They're supposed to be good. You're sitting with the player's wives. And don't forget to cheer for me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart was strangely quiet. Later he explained he was confused by feelings of respect for me. That wouldn't last.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Omigod! I don't believe it. It's really you, the Capital City ""Goofball.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, the fifth.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Right, Mr. Goofball.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I get up, I dance, I spell out the name of the city... all to the tune of Baby Elephant Walk.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who'd've thought it? A free ticket to a big league park but I was too tense to enjoy the game. Every ounce of concentration I possessed was focused on the task at hand.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, red hots.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mmm, these do taste better at the ballpark. Uh oh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I was graceful. I was witty. Brother, I was somethin'.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But they didn't care.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It was so quiet you could hear each individual smart-ass remark.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The only applause I got was for dragging my carcass out of there.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What a family.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,My wife and kids stood by me. On the way home I realized how little that helped.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So that's it. The costume's buried now. As my son would say, I'm one sad ape-like dude.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you guys are hanging on my every word. I've become the center of attention.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay. I wonder why stories of degradation and humiliation make you more popular.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bust my hump all week... stupid grass... supposed to be the boy's job.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"H'lo, Flanders.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who told? Marge! Beer me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Crabgrass? What are you talking about? Where?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There's nothing wrong with crabgrass! It just has a bad name, that's all. Everyone would love it if it had a cute name like... uh... elfgrass.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge! Where's the Duff?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't toy with me, woman.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, uh, okay. What the heck, I've earned a little break.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Holy moly! It's... it's... beautiful!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, we've only been neighbors, what? uh, one, two, three, four... eight years.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, but aren't we forgetting something, Flanders?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, beggars can't be choosy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, knock it off!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You've been rubbing my nose in it since I got here. Your family is better than my family. Your beer comes from farther away than my beer. You and your son like each other. Your wife's butt is higher than my wife's butt. You make me sick!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I wouldn't stay on a bet!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,One for the road.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Marge. But it's just that I'm still steamed up about that jerk Flanders. Lousy... bragging... know-it-all... show-off...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Get this. He said... he said... well, it wasn't so much what he said, it was how he said it!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well... he...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay. It wasn't how he said it either, but the message was loud and clear... our family stinks!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, he's perfect now, is he?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no, Marge. Don't backpedal. You were right the first time. He's perfect. Perfect in every way.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm just gonna go take a walk around the block to calm down. I got a little excited. I'm not perfect... like Ned Flanders.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Flanders!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Dear neighbor... ,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You are my brother. I love you and yet I feel a great sadness in my bosom.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wait! Wait! There's more...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Neighbors forever. Oh, no! Ned Flanders.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay, all right, all right. She's right! Let's do something together. What does everyone say to some miniature golf, followed by a round of frosty chocolate milkshakes?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Too bad we don't live on a farm. Let's go, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fore!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But I got it in the middle!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That was just a practice shot, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know, I know. I can still make this for five. Come on, baby, pleeze pleeze go in. Pleeze.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Flanders! What are you doing here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That shot is impossible! Jack Nicholson himself couldn't make it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Luck.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Never mind!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, he's entering and what's more, he's going to win, aren't you, boy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah! Well I think the fruit of my loins can beat the fruit of your loins any day of the week.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, this is the only time I'm ever gonna say this. It is not okay to lose.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stay, stay. Good dog. Now, keep your head down.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, not you. I'm talking to the boy. Keep your head down. Follow through...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, that didn't work. This time move your head and don't follow through.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What're you doing? That putter is to you what a bat is to a baseball player, what a violin is to the guy tha...the violin guy. Now, c'mon, give your putter a name.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, give it a name.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Do you wanna try a little harder, son? Come on, give it a girl's name.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Your putter's name is Charlene!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It just is. That's why.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, this is a picture of your enemy, Todd Flanders. Every day I want you to spend fifteen minutes staring at it and concentrating on how much you hate him and how glorious it will be when you and Charlene annihilate him.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll show you who Charlene is! Now start hating!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But, Marge, this is our big chance to show up the Flanderses.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Because sometimes the only way you can feel good about yourself is by making someone else look bad. And I'm tired of making other people feel good about themselves.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I said NOW!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart! What're you doing? Get down from there before the neighbors see --,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Flanders, I don't care what this looks like, Bart's gonna mop the floor with your son's ugly butt.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, ""may the best man win"". The mating call of the loser.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah? Wanna bet?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's right!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What, are you afraid to make a real bet?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"How about this Henny Penny? If Bart wins tomorrow, you have to mow my lawn.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Better yet, you have to mow my lawn in your wife's Sunday dress.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Read that back to me, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh man. Fine.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm game if you are, Flanders.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Keep your left arm straight, Bart... rotate your shoulders...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, son, all I'm asking is that you try.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Anybody can try! I want you to win!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, give me your honest opinion. This? Or this?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good morning, son! Oh, by the way, today's the day of the big tournament, and you'd better win!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"See you downstairs, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Heh heh... that crazy Marmaduke...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oatmeal?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"News flash, Lisa! Bart is not a horse. Eat your steak, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Flanders, it's no use praying. I already did the same thing, and we can't both win.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh... Well, Flan-ders, it doesn't matter. This time tomorrow, you'll be wearing high heels.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,'Fraid not.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,'Fraid not.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,'Fraid not infinity.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Woo-hoo-hoo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, Bart. Remember what Vince Lombardi said: ""If you lose, you're out of the family.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ohhh, so you're gonna welch on our bet?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I got it right here in writing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The father of the boy who doesn't win has to mow the lawn in his wife's Sunday dress.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's a small price to pay to see you humiliate yourself.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Listen to 'em laughing... This is so humiliating... I'm never gonna live this down... Damn Flanders...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Halftime, Marge, halftime.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh my God! He's enjoying it!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart! Stop fighting with your sister!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Stop it, you two! This is Thanksgiving! So glue friendly, or I'll take your glue away and then no one will have any glue to glue with!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Heh... heh... heh. Bullwinkle's antler sprung a leak.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bullwinkle.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Underdog! Don't you know anything?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, this is a tradition. If you start building a balloon for every flash-in-the-pan cartoon character, you'd turn the parade into a farce.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know, I will.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"See, Maggie? Those silver and blue guys are the Dallas Cowboys. They're Daddy's favorite team, and he wants them to lose by less than five and a half points. Understand?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hi, Patty. Hi, Selma.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Good to see ya. Well, gotta pick up my old man! 'Bye!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I love those kids! They've got such a great attitude!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, Dad. Let's get outta here.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This place is depressing.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, well, I'm sure it's a blast once you get used to it. Let's go.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,This thing's gonna be roaring any time now!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The hell with this.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Holy moly! That's the biggest... one of those I ever saw.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Speaking of heroes, here's mine... Tom Turkey!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, Bart that's it! Go to your room NOW!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...And, Lord, we're especially thankful for nuclear power, the cleanest, safest energy source there is, except for solar, which is just a pipe dream. Anyway, we'd like to thank you for the occasional moments of peace and love our family's experienced... well, not today. You saw what happened. Oh, Lord, be honest. Are we the most pathetic family in the universe, or what?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, Marge'll fix everything.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what are you doing?! No! Drop that drumstick! Bad dog! Bad Santa's Little Helper. Come on... gimme that. Gimme that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, out you go!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, Dad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, his girlfriend is the weather lady.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What show is this?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, operator? Gimme the number for 911!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Will you forget the report! He's down at the rescue mission!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well uh, we did kinda yell at him... and sent him to his room... and tried to force him to apologize to his sister.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We can, and will!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, are we ever gonna see him again?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh it's great to have you back, boy! We were afraid we'd lost you!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, boy. Get down on your knees and beg for forgiveness.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's your fault I'm bald!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Damn, no spots.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know Marge, we're great parents!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Lord, on this blessed day, we thank thee for giving our family one more crack at togetherness. Amen.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Rasputin's got the reach, but on the other hand, the Professor's got his patented coma lock. If you ask me, this is gonna be one hell of a match.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I don't see your name engraved on the bar stool.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whoa.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,TRUCKASAUROUS!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I have an announcement to make. As a family growth thing, Bart and I think we should all go to the Monster Truck Rally this Saturday.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh... Monster Truck Rally, growth thing... No, I don't think so.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, cruel fate. Why do you mock me?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eight o'clock, but what does it matter?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you're a genius.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Series?!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, good, unfinished. This shouldn't take long.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That was beautiful. Can we go now?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,How much longer was Sherbert planning on making this piece of junk?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, Flanders. Big know-it-all.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, Flanders, he's not that bad.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sometimes the best defense is a good offense.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Not now, Lisa.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Where, where?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Here you go, Bartasaurous.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh I can't watch.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, Bart. We're home, son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Kids say such stupid things.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on Marge, we're mad at 'im.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ewwww.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Amen! Well, Bart, has Dr. Hibbert made his point?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, hi, kids. Thanks.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You didn't mean that. Bart, this isn't one of those phoney-baloney promises I don't expect you to keep. If you make this promise, you have to keep it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Springfield Gorge? I thought we settled this daredevil junk.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I can and do. Go to your room, Bart! There, I've done it. I'm glad somebody finally stepped in and put an end to this nonsense once and for all.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"He's got us, Marge. There's nothing we can do. He's as good as dead.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that never works. He's a goner.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay. I'll try.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart? Bart?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart! What are you doing?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You were on your way to jump the gorge, weren't you?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, I know I can't stop you. The only thing I can do is ask you to promise me you won't jump the gorge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"'Cause if you don't, I'll never believe anything you say, ever again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I mean it, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's my boy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, Marge, we got a pretty good kid there.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, boy. Wanna toss the old --",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why that little liar! I should... and I was gonna play pickle with him.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,BART!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, I've tried ordering you, I've tried punishing you, and God help me, I even tried reasoning with you, and the only thing left for me to do is for me to jump the gorge myself.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Because that way you'll see what it's like to witness a family member stupidly risking his life for no good reason.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't you think I know that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Goodbye, son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ohhh, thank God. Thank God. Thank God.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I love you too, son. You know, boy, I don't think I've ever felt as close to you as I do right --",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm going to make it! I'm going to make it! This is the greatest thrill of my life! I'm king of the world! Woo hoo! Woo hoo!! I--,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You think you've got guts, try raising my kids.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, Marge, you make the best pork chops in the whole world.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm gonna build you a spice rack!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's no trouble. I've got a whole garageful of tools I never use.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Shut up, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I knew all this stuff would come in handy some day. Let's see now... ah, here it is. The Complete Handyman's Bookshelf. Volume One. Spice Rack.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Pick - up - a - ham - mer...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wowww....,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I can't. It's broken.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Keep her away from me, Marge! She's got that crazy look in her eyes again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You heard me. I won't be in for the rest of the week. I told you. My baby beat me up. Oh, it is not the worst excuse I ever thought up. Wise guy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, how come you can watch cartoons but the kids can't?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Because why?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Because you said so, why?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh. What are you doing?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Heh, heh, heh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but what are ya gonna do?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Everybody's looking at us, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh. Well, how long are we going to have to be doing this?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I didn't know they still made TV dinners this bad.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,There's peas in my fruit cobbler.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, tomorrow night, how about making some of your patented pork chops?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Twenty million women in the world and I had to marry Jane Fonda.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, some of these stories are pretty good. I never know mice lived such interesting lives.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Take that you dumb squirrel.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Where do they get their ideas?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,One thousand dollars.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, sorry.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I was watching that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"... Oh, hey, thank you, Maggie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sit down, boy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wow. What great kids. This is the golden age, Marge. And the parents of Springfield owe it all to you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I always knew you'd change the world, for the better.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, get the door.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Really? Great!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, there he is... Michelangelo's Dave.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh. What's wrong, Marge?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, don't worry Marge, pretty soon every boy and girl in Springfield Elementary School is gonna come and see this thing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They're forcing 'em.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He's awake!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, yeah! Who are you? I saw you chasing Bart's ambulance...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ooo, classy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, the fiend who did this to my boy is my boss. And besides, the doctor says it's just a bump on the head and a broken toe. Nothing serious.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wow...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah. If I wasn't so spineless, I'd march into Mr. Burns' office right now and...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nice to meet you too, sir.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A hundred bucks?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"W-well... It's a v-very generous offer, sir. But... his medical bills alone...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You don't have to do that, Mr. Burns. I can throw myself out.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey! Lionel Hutz...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You sure have got some education, Mr. Hutz.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fifty percent?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Well... I dunno... You and I might have different ideas about just how big a big cash settlement is.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whoo ooo! I stand corrected. A million bucks is A-okay!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whiplash! Oh no!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, son.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, of course you're not going to die. Everything's fine!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Dr. Hibbert from Johns Hopkins Medical School?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just give me a ticket.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, what? What is it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Don't mind if I do.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Burns, are you trying to get me drunk?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You mean duke it out?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Five hundred thousand dollars!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, Marge, what do you think?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll tell you what I think. I think he thinks I'm an idiot. The only reason he's offering us this is because he knows he's gonna lose the trial and have to pay us a cool million.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Five hundred thousand dollars. I spit on his five hundred thousand dollars.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, the truth!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Will that hold up in court?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,A million dollars. My wife cost me a million dollars.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, a million dollars worth you treacherous snake woman. No, thank you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No I don't want any string beans either you two-timing, back-stabbing. Uh oh I better answer. No, thank you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, thank you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, dear. Would it be all right if I went over to Moe's for a drink?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I don't know if I'll ever come back here. Goodnight.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, that's it. I guess this is the class I'm gonna die in.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Moe, I wish he'd shut up.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, hey, guys. Knock it off. It's just my wife.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, no, no. You think this is about money? Well, it's not. It's worse, Marge. I'm afraid that from now on when I look at you, I'm not gonna see the wife by my side or the mother of my children. I'm just gonna see the dame who blew my one big chance.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm saying... She's been your wife for ten years, you've had three children together, it's time to be honest with her. I'm not sure I love you anymore.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But don't worry. I'll never let on. I'll still do all the bed stuff. Maybe it won't be so bad.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Alright, alright, look at her if it'll make her shut up. Start with the feet, still angry? Good, good Homer, good. This is tough, need refreshment. Ahh, good old trustworthy beer, my love for you will never die. Alright, alright, gotta look the wife straight in the eyes and tell her.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, who am I kidding? I love you more than ever.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Sorry to scare you like that, babe.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is it done yet? Is it done yet?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Isn't there anything faster than a microwave? Four, three, two, one, ping!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,We have meatloaf!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yum. I've got a dried out end-piece with your name on it, Lisa.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What are you getting at?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What are you talking about? Nobody's trying to teach you that.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Shut up, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Tomorrow night!? Friday!? Pork chop night!? Marge, we haven't missed pork chop night since the great pig scare in '87.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay, okay, okay. Where do you want to go?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine. We'll go to Mars.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"If I said no the first time, what makes you think I'm gonna say yes the second time?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, try me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, okay, okay!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, okay. HELLO!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's so hard to choose. It all looks so terrible. Just bring me one of these, and one of these, and one of those.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Good thing I'm open-minded.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hmmm. Hmmm. Not bad. Interesting.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll try this little pink one, here. Hmmm, very good. Another one.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh boy, this fish is dee-lish!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"... oh, oh, and two of these things.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And, Oh, Oh, I don't believe I've tried the flying fish roe...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're the doctor!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,There's gotta be something I haven't tried. Huh? Hey! What's this? Fugu!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, pal! Fugu me!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I want fugu!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Mmmm. Fan-fugu-tastic.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Beautiful language, isn't it, Marge?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I couldn't possibly.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Poison! What should I do? What should I do? Tell me quick!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Try something new, Homer. What'll it hurt you, Homer?"" I never heard of a poison pork chop.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No need, Doc. I can read Marge like a book.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh! It's good news, isn't it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Twenty-four hours?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Marge, I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No way! Because I'm not dying.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why you little --,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's after fear? What's after fear?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Doc, you gotta get me out of this. I'll make it worth your while.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, we all gotta go some time.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Told ya. Now, come on. You're gonna learn how to shave.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So you're going to die... ,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, Marge? Hello? I'm the one who's dying, not you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Nothing. It'll just upset them. I want my last hours of family life to be happy ones.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Almost.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm not done yet, Marge. What's that word you use for when you and I... you know...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Be intimate with Marge.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, watch the sunrise.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Till six a.m., my dearest darling and my last day on earth.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Eleven-thirty! Oh, that's just great.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, why did you let me sleep so late?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,There'll be plenty of time for that! I've got tons of important stuff to do.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart! Bart!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Have man-to-man with Bart.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come here, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nooo, I just want to have a heart-to-heart talk.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You know, Bart, after me, you're the man around the house, and that means you're gonna have to help out with --",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Shut up! Bart, this is good stuff. I want to share something with you -- the three little sentences that will get you through life. Number one, ""cover for me."" Number two, ""oh, good idea, boss."" Number three, ""it was like that when I got here.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"...and, finally, the little spot under your nose. Next, we take some toilet paper, tear off some teensy little squares, and stick one there, and there, and any place you're bleeding. There and there. Don't worry, the blood will hold it right on your face. Now, some aftershave.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ah! Ooh! Arg! Son of a -- ! Ah! And that's how we shave.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Why you little --",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that's my boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Listen to Lisa play her sax.,,,,,

A gentle man who loved his children and...",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Hey, Barney, look. It was on my list, along with a lot of other things I didn't get to do today. Hey, my boss!",,,,,

Homer Simpson,Wow! Of all the luck! To think I almost died without telling the boss to eat my shorts.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I gotta call Marge.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it was busy. Moe, another last beer, please.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Guys, keep it down. I got some last words. I never told you this before, but sometimes when I'm at work, I think of you and smile. So often I think that ... oh, words won't do it. I love you, Moe.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I love you, Barney.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, Barney, I gotta get home.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Oh, I can't wait any longer. Hold on, Marge. I'm comin' home, baby.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,All right. Stop it! Cut it out!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What are you talking about?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm alive! I'm alive. And I couldn't be happier. From this day forward, I vow to live life to its fullest!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Do you two have to sit so close to the TV? Back up, or it'll hurt your eyes.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh yes it will.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,That makes two of us.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I love watching the bald guy argue with the fat tub of lard.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, all right. Time for Dr. TV to perform a little surgery.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Shut up, boy. Cheap Chinese TVs... Why did I every buy... Is that better?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How's this?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, just everybody remain calm.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, yeah, yeah. I think I can.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,I... I don't know!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,She's mine!,,,,,

Homer Simpson,I'm Homer.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,J.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Simpson.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"Look, I'm not asking you to like me, I'm not asking you to put yourself in a position where I can touch your goodies, I'm just asking you to be fair.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, what's the good word?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm... a spare. Excuse me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, so....",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You tutor?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And anyone can be tooted?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,French. What a coincidence. Just the subject I'm having trouble with.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,"I'll take that as a compliment. So, will you go out with me? Please say oui.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ohhh! oh, Marge! This'll be the greatest night of your life. I've been saving up for a new engine for my car, but I'm gonna spend it all on us. I'm renting the biggest limo. I'm gonna buy you the biggest corsage. My tux is gonna have the widest lapels, the most ruffles, and the highest platform shoes you ever saw.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wait, wait, wait, Marge. If honest and open is what you like, get a load of this. I'm not really in any French class. This was just a brilliant scheme to get to know you better.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ow.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Barney, guess whose got a date for the prom?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is Marge here?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'm her date.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, okay.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, Mr. B.",,,,,

Homer Simpson,She's with him.,,,,,

Homer Simpson,Barney!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, isn't she great? Hail Queen Marge! Woo woo! Long live the Queen!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I gotta get outta here.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Because I'm sure we were meant to be together. Usually when I have a thought there's a lot of other thoughts in there. Something says yes, something says no. But this time there's only yes. How could the only thing I've ever been sure about in my life be wrong?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Inspiration Point.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Naw, that's okay. I'm broke. I'll walk home.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Shut up. I'm over as far as I can go!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, all right! I'll walk in the mud!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sure.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Who? Oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, pour vous.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I've got a problem. Once you stop this car, I'm gonna hug you and kiss you and then I'll never be able to let you go.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I never have.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Flanders. Who put that bug up your butt?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, what's this world coming to?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Gotta go.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, stop, cable man! Stop!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I want free cable.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"So this is okay, I mean everybody does it, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,So You've Decided To Steal Cable.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"""Myth: Cable piracy is wrong. Fact: Cable companies are big faceless corporations, which makes it okay.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Cable. It's more wonderful than I dared hope.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,It's funny 'cause it's true!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, hey, hey. Family, family, come here. I have an announcement to make. The Simpsons have cable.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,That's right. Sixty-eight channels. MTV for the kids. VH-1 for us. Sixteen hundred hours of quality programming every day!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Nothing a month? Yeah, I think we can swing that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, Marge. Take a look at this.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Marge --,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hear Me Roar -- The Network For Women.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooo. Pro wrestling from Mexico. You know, down there it's a real sport.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,They must think people will watch anything.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Huh, wha'? Oh, okay.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oooh. Pizza.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,The lad has a point.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Read the pamphlet, honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, goody! A program-length advertisements!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, great... All right, what makes you say that?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, duh.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh. Hm, look at it this way. When you had breakfast this morning, did you pay for it?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,And did you pay for those clothes you're wearing?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, run for the hills, Ma Barker, before I call the Feds.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, thank you honey.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Whooo!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, boy!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,How can one little insulated wire bring so much happiness?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"We could do that, hmm, yeah, or... we could go over to my house and watch the whole thing live on cable TV.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Pass the pumice, please.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, that's right. Eight o'clock, my place. Come one, come all.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, Friday night. You want to come over?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, too bad. It's gonna be a great fight.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Son, you shouldn't watch that other channel. It's only for mommies and daddies who love each other very much. I want you to promise me you won't watch that channel ever again.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Promise me.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Good boy.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey Lisa -- Racing from Belmont? Horsies!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"There is something wrong with that kid. She's so moral. Why can't she be more like... well, not like Bart, but there's gotta be a happy medium.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Unhook it?! But I love cable.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look, look, Marge. I can't afford it. When I can afford to pay for it, I will. But I can't, so I'm not going to.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I never put my foot down about anything.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,...but I am severely tempted to do it over this.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm sorry, I think it's coming down.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"It's coming down. My foot is, that's it, Marge. It's coming down. The cable stays. The foot has spoken.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Seen it. Seen it. Seen it. Seen it. Ugh! Soccer. Seen it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Huh? Hey, how'd you get in here?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Get out of my house! I don't wanna associate with criminals.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,He's not home.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, we can't be too careful. There are thieves everywhere, and I'm not talking about the small, forgivable stuff.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh? What the? I know you -- come back here...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, you promised me you wouldn't watch that trash! Now go to your room.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh great.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just a select circle of my friends.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, didja swipe those from work?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Quick, it's Moe. I gotta hide the mugs...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, will you... Hey, go protest outside will ya, now!.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, thank you, Moe! I always wanted one of these.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Burns! Bart... quick. Hide the stuff I ""borrowed"" from work.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right, the stuff I stole from work!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Now, c'mon. Take all this, and this, put it in the closet.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Will you quit staring at me like that!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ugh, ah, hello, Mr. Burns. Would you like to watch the fight?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Yeah.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No... No I... It wasn't me... It was it was my wife's, my wife's idea... yeah, yeah... I would never...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, sure, sure. Be my guest.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, Lisa, Maggie...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Excuse me. I hate to interrupt your judging me, but I wanted you to know I've made a couple of really important decisions. Number one: I'm cutting the cable as soon as the fight's over. And Number Two: I'm not very fond of any of you.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, at the worst possible time.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The greatest fight ever and I missed it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Cable clippers, please.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oops.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Third time's the charm.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ooh! Barbecue!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,This is like some beautiful dream.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, honey, I've got five words to say to you. Greasy Joe's Bottomless Bar-B-Q Pit.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm only human. Now look, here's what we're gonna do. We'll unload the kids on Patty and Selma Saturday night. And then we'll eat until they kick us out of the place. Just like old times.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I'll take that bet.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'll tell you one thing, Greasy Joe is sorry he ever saw the likes of me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh and that sauce, Barney. I could have drunk a bowl of it by itself! No Barney, that's just my sister-in-law.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Remember? Who could forget?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,But that was just an idle promise.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Find a husband? Which one's Selma again?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. But I thought she didn't like to be... you know, touched.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,But Marge...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Okay.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hey! Why should she have a better husband than you do?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Must find man. Must find man. Must find man.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, a good man really is hard to find.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"One seafood burrito, Apu.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sorry.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What is it this time?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But enough about Bart. Tell me, Principal Skinner, are you married?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But if you weren't married to your job, you'd tend to go for a girl, right?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no reason, really. I was just wondering if you know, you'd like to come over to my house for dinner. A payback for all the crummy things Bart has done to your school.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Excellent.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Heh heh heh. Here we go. Boy meets beast. Principal Skinner, allow me to introduce you to my wife's lovely and available sister, Selma.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Wha...?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yes, plenty of fish. We just don't have any bait.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, Moe. I've gotta find a date for my big, fat, snotty sister-in-law, Selma.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Like my wife's ugly sister.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Selma's no prize pig herself you know.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But' nothing, Marge. She's a heifer, plain and simple.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, there's the little prom queen now.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Is that Selma? Ring-a-ding-ding!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Take it to the hoop, Selma.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"... And thank you most of all for nuclear power, which is yet to cause a single proven fatality, at least in this country. Amen.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Quiet, you kids! If I hear one more word, Bart doesn't get to watch cartoons and Lisa doesn't get to go to college.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Not one word.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I thought I said knock it off!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, no panta-ma-mime, either.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,The hospital? Y'ello... Oh my God!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What is it, Da --",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh Dad, you and your imagination.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,A half-brother?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"This makes me feel special, Dad. Since I'm the one you kept, that must mean you really love me.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I'm going to find my brother. I don't care what it takes. If I have to move heaven and earth, I'm going to find him!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I guess he's got us there.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Bart!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Twen... forty-eight. This is it.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Excuse me, is this an orphanage?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thirty years! I'll never find him. I'm doomed to walk through this life alone. Oh brother, where art thou?!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh. Hee, hee. Sorry.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, well, I wish I could help you but we're looking for my brother today. Can you tell me his name?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Herbert. Herbert Powell. Great! Where can I find him?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh please, please, this is my life we're talking about here. Please...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I know, he could be anywhere! That's why I want you to narrow it down! Please...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, if you ask me, changing the subject makes you the most worthless, heartless, excuse for a human being I ever...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, oh... I get it. Okay. Here's twenty bucks. Now will you tell me where my brother lives?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just take it and tell me!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Fine. Thank you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Let's see, Powell, Powell... Powell... Pomerant, Poole, Popkin, Potter, Quigley, Quimby, Randolph... whoops, too far. Here it is, Powell.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No, I've called all three Herbert Powells in Detroit. Nothing.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"H! Of course. That could stand for Herbert! It's a long shot, but...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, is this H. Powell of Detroit, Michigan?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,By any chance does the H stand for Herbert?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Woo woo! The H stands for Herbert! Herb, were you adopted?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,From the Shelbyville Orphanage?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Because... ... I'm your baby brother, Homer!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hello? Hello? Hello? Stupid phone!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, sorry.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, Brother! Grab the next plane to Springfield. We got a couch that folds out...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Just a little further. Just a little further. Just a little further. Just a little further.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, I want to see my brother--",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"That's okay, carry on. See the way I handled that, Marge?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What does it look like?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, this can't be the right address.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hello in there.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Herb?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Holy moly! The bastard's rich!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Herb, allow me to introduce my family. This is my wife, Marge...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"... and our three children, Bart, Lisa and Maggie.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, though the boy was a close call.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's to know? Just dive in. Catch!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,I feel the same about you.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Even pork chops?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"You mean, if I want pork chops -- even in the middle of the night -- your guy'll fry 'em up?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Wai-wai-wait, wait, wait. Let me see if I got this straight... It's Christmas day, four a.m., there's a rumble in my stomach...",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Will you kids shut up?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, we're watching.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, Cook? Sorry to bother you so late, but I got a hankerin' for some... that's right... don't forget the apple sauce!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Are you sure you want to give me a car?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, okay. I'd like a big one, then.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Why not?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, then give me one with lots of pep.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,America.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You do.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I want to let you!!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hi'ya, team.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,I dunno.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What's that?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All right. Wooo, what's that doohickey?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah, he did!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, okay.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ugh, oh boy.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oh fine. We're putting in an on-board something-or-other and rack-and-peanut steering...,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Huh?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, yeah, I think I did.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, may I be excused, please?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Because you think I'm a genius?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Because you think I'm dynamic?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,You think I work well with others?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, great.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, Unky Herb, I don't know anything about cars.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sort of.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,What?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Sort of!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,All right you eggheads! I want a place in this car to put my drink!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Hel-lo? Hel-lo Einstein? I said a place to put my drink. You know those Super Slakers they sell at the Kwik-E-Mart? The cup is this big!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And I'm not done yet. You know that little ball you put on the aerial so you can find your car in a parking lot? That should be on every car.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,And some things are so snazzy they never go out of style! Like tail fins! And bubble domes! And shag carpeting!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"I want a horn here, here and here. You can never find a horn when you're mad. And they should all play ""La Cucaracha.""",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"And sometimes, the kids are in the back seat, they're hollering, they're making you nuts. There's got to be something you can do about that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,You're fired! What is my brother paying you for?,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Bullseye! And another thing. When I gun the motor, I want people to think the world is coming to an end! VROOM! VROOM! VROOM!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,No! No! No! No! No!,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"All my life, I have searched for a car that feels a certain way.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Powerful, like a gorilla, yet soft and yielding, like a Nerf ball. Now, at last, I have found it.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Gee, Herb, because of me you lost your business, your home, and all your possessions. I can't help but think that maybe you would have been better off if I'd never come into your life.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Ooo.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Get in, Dad. I'll explain on the way home.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"What is it, boy?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, boy. I was waiting for someone to say that.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"No! No! No! Bad dog! Let go! Bad Santa's Little Helper! Stop it! No, not the sports section! No!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Stupid dog.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,No! Stay away! This is not for you! This is Homer food.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, the dog is hungry!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, Master.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,,,,,,
Homer Simpson,Y'ello.,,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, are you? Well, you go ahead and call your precious dog warden, you old battle-ax, because my dog is tied up in the backyard.",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Are you losing your hearing, or are you just stupid? I am going to explain this to you one more time, and then I am going to hang up on you. It is not my dog. I tied my dog outside myself. I am looking at him right --",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Lenny, I need to leave early. Cover for me, will ya?",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Well, well. Mr. Universe takes a walk. Haw, haw!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,"Look at that get-up. Heavy hands, ankle weights, that's cute, and ... Assassins!",,,,,
Homer Simpson,Oooh! Oooh! How much? How much? How much?,,,,,
